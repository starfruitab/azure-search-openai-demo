### TPMS

**TPMS** is the maintenance methodology to handle all maintenance-related work processes from development and the whole life cycles for TetraPak® equipment. The **TPMS** methodology is reliability-centred (best industry practice) and aims at finding the right combination of predetermined, condition-based, and corrective maintenance. In maintenance, the challenge is to find the right level of investment in parts and labour effort to achieve the desired performance, quality, and reliability. Thanks to **TPMS**, it is possible to create maintenance plans with a good balance between what is invested and what it received in return.

### How TPMS Works

Users around the globe continuously feed the system with maintenance data. The data is continuously evaluated and then utilised to improve maintenance recommendations and customer-specific scheduling of maintenance tasks. **TPMS** takes a holistic approach to maintenance by including the actions needed to contribute to plant efficiency. With this advanced maintenance management tool, the maintenance checklists are designed to include latest updates of our recommendations to meet the demands for fewer unscheduled stops, reduced waste, and less interference with production.

### TPMS Maintenance Recommendation Overview

With the TetraPakGroup's extensive experience of managing maintenance on TetraPak® packaging lines, together with our advanced maintenance management tools, we can support you in tailoring the right maintenance plans (checklists) to follow the maintenance system in a consistent way. Using **TPMS** is a foundation to having your equipment run at its best. Checklists can be managed and delivered directly from your local TetraPak service station. In the checklist you will find information concerning what tasks shall be done and when they shall be done. Furthermore, the document reference will give guidance as to how to perform the work. The document references are **MM**, **SPC**, **OM**, **RM**, **EM**, and **TeM**.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000261822.png)

**Note:** The layout of the checklist is subject to change.

For those customers that intend to set up their own maintenance system and plans, the TetraPakGroup can on a upon-request basis provide a maintenance recommendation overview for the specific equipment, including tasks required to keep the equipment in good condition. The recommendation will be provided free of charge for up to a year after delivery.

### Safe Manual Handling

Use mechanical lifting aids whenever possible. If mechanical lifting aids are not available, do not attempt to lift loads over 23 kg without the assistance of a colleague. Avoid lifting below knee height and above shoulder height. If it is necessary to lift from the floor, follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of back and disc injuries.

*   Use safety shoes and be sure that the surface of the floor is not slippery.
    
*   Get close to the load.
    
*   Take a wide stance and find the best positions for your feet.
    
*   Bend your hips and knees, and use your leg muscles.
    
*   Keep the load close to your body.
    
*   Do not twist your body while moving the load.
    
*   Take small steps when turning.
    

In order to reduce the risk of injury to discs and back muscles, be careful to not bend or twist your back when lifting. Keep the load close to your body to reduce the strain on your back.

To reduce the ergonomic risks to each individual operator, job rotation is recommended, so that recovery and variety are provided.

### Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)

Chemical hazard.

Always read and follow the instructions in the safety data sheet supplied by the manufacturer or local supplier, when handling chemicals.

Contact with corrosive chemicals can cause serious injury, or illness.

In both liquid and gas states, hydrogen peroxide may cause irritation or damage if it comes into contact with skin, mucous membranes, eyes, or clothes. Call for medical attention immediately if there is an accident.

Liquid hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of less than 1% is generally considered harmless to humans.

Consult the instructions on the label of the tank or container.

### Emergency Procedures

If there is an accident involving hydrogen peroxide, rinse the affected area as soon as possible with large amounts of water.

### Eyes

*   wash the eyes thoroughly with lukewarm water for 15 minutes (keep eyelids wide apart)
    
*   call for medical attention immediately
    

### Skin

*   rinse immediately with plenty of water
    
*   call for medical attention immediately if skin burns appear
    
*   thoroughly wash the clothes before wearing them again
    

### Inhalation

*   leave the affected area and get some fresh air
    
*   call for medical attention if the symptoms get worse
    

### Ingestion

*   do not attempt to cause vomiting
    
*   drink large amounts of lukewarm water to dilute the peroxide
    
*   call for medical attention immediately
    

### Personal Protective Equipment

*   protective goggles (for instance, TP No. 90303-11), tight fitting
    
    If there is a risk of splashes, a visor is a suitable complement
    
*   protective gloves made of neoprene (for instance, TP No. 90303-12), nitrile, or butyl rubber
    
*   protective apron (for instance, TP No. 90303-13), or protective suit when handling larger amounts
    
*   protective shoes or boots made of PVC, PE plastic, or rubber
    
*   proper respiratory equipment, if ventilation is insufficient
    

### Handling of Hydrogen Peroxide

Chemical hazard.

Avoid any contamination of hydrogen peroxide.

Sudden and violent chemical reaction.

Hydrogen peroxide can react very suddenly and violently in combination with many compounds, or if it is contaminated. Never pour surplus hydrogen peroxide back into the original container. There is a risk of a violent decomposition liberating oxygen and heat, with a big increase in volume due to the oxygen generated by the peroxide decomposition. This will cause a large overpressure if the contaminated hydrogen peroxide is in a closed container. If the integrity of the container fails, this could result in a dangerous hazard.

Ensure that equipment used for handling and diluting hydrogen peroxide is clean before it comes in contact with hydrogen peroxide. Pumps or other equipment used for handling hydrogen peroxide must be **used for this purpose only** and must be manufactured from appropriate materials, such as stainless steel 316 L, glass, polyethylene, or teflon. After use, make sure that all peroxide residue is rinsed away.

If hydrogen peroxide is spilled, dilute it with large amounts of water. Dispose of the diluted hydrogen peroxide according to local regulations.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000028990.png)

Chemical hazard.

Never wipe up hydrogen peroxide with materials such as rags or paper as these may self-ignite several hours after contact. If there is a fire, spray with large quantities of water.

Risk of self-ignition.

### Storage of Hydrogen Peroxide

Chemical hazard.

Keep the container upright and fitted with its proper ventilation cap. If there is a fire, cool all containers by spraying them with large quantities of water.

Containers may become overpressurised if they are not properly ventilated. If the integrity of a container fails, this could result in a dangerous hazard.

Hydrogen peroxide decomposes much faster with increasing temperature. There is a risk of a container becoming overpressurised at high temperatures, since the ventilation cap cannot release the gases produced quickly enough. If the integrity of the container fails, this could result in a dangerous hazard.

Hydrogen peroxide **must** be stored in the **original container** delivered by the supplier. Keep the container upright and fitted with its proper ventilation cap, which allows oxygen to escape. Otherwise there is a risk of overpressurisation of the container due to violent decomposition of the peroxide. If the integrity of the container fails, this could result in a dangerous hazard.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000028989.png)

Make sure that the container is always properly closed.

Commercial food-grade hydrogen peroxide has been stabilized to inhibit the catalytic decomposition effects of metals and other impurities, but it can decompose into oxygen and water if it is exposed to heat or contaminated.

*   cool, clean, and well ventilated
    
*   shielded from direct sunlight
    
*   kept free from combustible materials
    

### Disposal of Hydrogen Peroxide

Always read and follow the disposal instructions in the safety data sheet supplied by the manufacturer or local supplier.

### Ultraviolet Light

### Definition of Lockout Procedure

A lockout procedure is a procedure to put each necessary energy isolating device in its safe position to prevent the energisation of the equipment, such as when a maintenance procedure should be carried out.

A lockout is the use of a device, for example, a padlock, to make sure that an energy isolating device cannot be operated.

An energy isolating device is a mechanical device that physically prevents transmission or release of energy, such as an electrical supply disconnecting device.

When a utility should be LOCKED in the OFF position according to the Equipment Status row of a Procedure Start Table, the lockout procedure for that utility is applicable.

A detailed instruction for the specific lockout procedure(s) for this equipment is found in the General chapter of the Maintenance Manual, or the General section of the Maintenance Instructions chapter of the Technical Manual.

### Electrical Supply

Hazardous voltage and moving machinery.

The electrical supply disconnecting device must be in position O (OFF) and secured with a lock before any work with the equipment that requires the electrical supply to be disconnected. See the Machine Status row in the table at the beginning of the applicable procedure.

**Note:** The key to the lock must be removed by the technician and retained in his/her possession until all work is completed.

Hazardous voltage can be present with the electrical supply disconnecting device in position O (OFF).

Circuits identified by orange-coloured conductors are not disconnected by the main electrical supply disconnecting device. The location of the electrical supply disconnecting device of these circuits is described in the Maintenance Manual procedures that include work on these types of circuit.

Certain procedures may require that the electrical supply disconnecting device is in position **|** (ON). These exceptions are clearly stated in the manuals.

### Equipment for Lifting and Moving Loads

Risk of crushing.

Make sure that the capacity of the lifting equipment is adequate and that the equipment itself is in proper working order.

The equipment can be heavy and can cause injury and death if it falls.

If lifting tackle must be joined to make up the necessary lengths, make sure that the joints are secure and have the same lifting capacity as the rest of the lifting tackle.

Always engage safety clips fitted to lifting hooks to prevent the lifting tackle from slipping off.

Use ropes or poles to steady and manoeuvre suspended loads. Do **not** use hands or feet.

Make sure that the route and destination are free from obstacles before moving a suspended load. It must always be possible to quickly and safely lower the load to the floor in an emergency.

When depositing loads, keep lifting tackle in place until the stability of the load has been substantiated.

### Working at Height

This equipment is provided with a means of access to all locations where routine tasks for operation and maintenance need to be carried out.

Risk of falling.

For any kind of work at height, always ensure that safe means of access is available and used. Where additional safe means of access other than provided with the equipment is required, follow local work at height regulations and guidelines. Use scaffolds or a mobile work platform and a safety harness. Create a safety perimeter around the working area and secure tools or other objects from falling.

### Nitrogen

Chemical hazard.

Provide good ventilation or local exhaust to prevent accumulation of high concentrations of gas. Oxygen levels in the work area must be monitored to ensure that they do not fall below 19.5%. To ensure enough oxygen concentration in the ambient air, establish an oxygen monitoring system. Consult your local authority regarding regulatory requirements. An oxygen monitoring system is not included in the TetraPak® supply.

Risk of death or personal injury. Nitrogen is a nontoxic, odourless, colourless, nonflammable compressed gas, which can cause rapid suffocation at high concentrations. Contact with skin can cause frostbite. Inhalation of cold gas can damage the lungs. Risk of explosion of equipment/pipes due to pressure increase, when nitrogen expands from a fluent to gas state.

### Confined Space

Confined space.

Assess the hazards, ensure the training of the personnel, ensure appropriate equipment for rescue operations are in place and that personnel know how to use it, and use lockout procedures whenever appropriate.

Risk of severe injury or death from entering or working in a confined space in the equipment. Entering or working in a confined space may result in the necessity for a rescue operation, which is time consuming and if not planned and executed properly, can introduce new risks.

*   loss of consciousness from the rise in body temperature
    
*   contact with media or chemicals
    
*   unexpected start-up of the equipment
    
*   the nature of the work that is performed
    
*   ingress of gases
    

Loss of consciousness or reduced mobility that is caused by incident or disease (for example stroke or cardiac arrest) will lead to rescue operations that are time-consuming and require dedicated skills and equipment.

To avoid risk of injury, avoid working in a confined space whenever possible. Adopt alternative methods that allow work to be done remotely or from outside the confined space. Work in a different manner that avoids the risk whenever it is reasonably practical to do so.

Should work within the confined space be necessary, ensure that local workplace health and safety legislation and site operating procedures for working in confined spaces are complied with.

*   site operating procedures for confined spaces are missing
    
*   necessary rescue equipment is missing
    
*   all involved personnel have not been trained
    

Contact the TetraPakGroup, or seek other competent guidance.

For TetraPak® personnel and contractors, the Procedure for Confined Spaces and local Standard Operating Procedures apply.

### Product Pressure

Risk of personal injury.

To avoid exposure, make sure that skilled personnel carry out the appropriate action.

There is a risk of injury due to equipment parts in motion, or exposure to gas or liquids under pressure, caused by residual pressure in the pressurised equipment if the equipment has not been depressurised fully.

Pre-treatment ASU
-----------------

### Functional Description

The vaporised hydrogen peroxide from the pre-treatment evaporators is lead through hoses and out the peroxide spray nozzles inside the [Pre-treatment box](#Pre-treatmentBoxpre-treatmentBoxes-CEA26C2E). See also Chapter [Carton Section](#section312). The [Pre-treatment box](#Pre-treatmentBoxpre-treatmentBoxes-CEA26C2E) collect and transport the excessive vaporised hydrogen peroxide to the [Condenser](#Condensercondenser-CEA27419) where the hydrogen peroxide vapour condensates and is lead to the [Buffer tank](#BufferTankbufferTank-CEA27AE9) on side 2 of the **ASU**.

**Note:** The hydrogen peroxide from the condenser has a concentration of >3%.

The tank is provided with a [Float switch](#FloatSwitchfloatSwitch-CEA28158), making sure that the [Buffer tank](#BufferTankbufferTank-CEA27AE9) is partially filled with water. During production, the buffer tank will be filled with hydrogen peroxide to a certain point. When the float switch has reached that level, more water will be added to dilute the hydrogen peroxide to a concentration of <3%. The buffer tank is then drained.

### Sleeve Size Guideline

This chapter is a guideline to adjusting the sleeve size. Some of the adjustments mentioned here are also available in other chapters, for example in 2.4.2-3 Conveyor - Basic Setting of Vertical Position - Folding Pipes, 2.4.3-4 Sleeve Forming Unit - Fine Adjust Top Size - Sleeve, and 2.4.3-5 Sleeve Forming Unit - Set Bottom and Top Size for Sleeve.

### General

There are different parameters that affect the sleeve size. In this guideline the focus is on the parameters with largest impact on the sleeve size. They are: creasing roller distance, distance between squeezer roller and conveyor belt, distances between folding pipe bracket and conveyor belt (rear and front) and dial.

See descriptions and illustrations in Chapter [Initial Settings](#section410).

### Prerequisites

1.  Set squeezer gap. See [Conveyor - Set Squeezer Wheels](#section393).
    
    **Note:** For some packaging material, for example Al foil, the squeezer wheel gap may need to be larger than in the instruction.
    
2.  Set cutting unit. See [Cutting Unit](#section314) .
    
3.  Set folder. See [Folder](#section369).
    
4.  Set sleeve rollers. See [Conveyor - Sleeve Roller - Basic Setting](#section394).
    
5.  Set and clean LS-heater. See [LS-Heater](#section381).
    
6.  Set creasing position. See 6.1 Machine Settings in the OM. Always set the creasing position when changing a material roll.
    
7.  Set creasing centering. See [Creasing Unit - Check Centering](#section219).
    
8.  Set temperatures for the SA oven and the LS oven. See 6.1 Machine settings in the OM Package Checks.

### Graphical Representation of Responses

In the following graph, the setting value is represented by the vertical lines. The top sleeve size and the bottom sleeve size are represented by the horizontal lines.

When moving the setting value left or right, the intersection between the setting value and the sleeve size follows the graphs.

When moving from the [Original setting value](#OriginalSettingValueoriginalSetting-677E1F6E) to the [New setting value](#NewSettingValuenewSettingValue-677E239C) in the graph, the sleeve sizes move from [Original bottom sleeve size](#OriginalBottomSleeveSizeoriginalBot-67848305) to [Smaller bottom size](#SmallerBottomSizesmallerBottomSize-6784891A) and [Original top sleeve size](#OriginalTopSleeveSizeoriginalTopSle-67848D2A) to [Smaller top size](#SmallerTopSizesmallerTopSize-67849062) respectively

The following example shows what response is to be expected when lowering the parameter “Dial”.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002984147.png)

*   Original setting value
*   New setting value

*   Original bottom sleeve size
*   Original top sleeve size

*   Smaller bottom size
*   Smaller top size

The graph **Bracket Rear Minus Front** describes the difference between the **Bracket Rear** value and the **Bracket Front** value. For example, if the **Bracket Rear** value is 79 and the **Bracket Front** value is 77, the setting value for **Bracket Rear Minus Front** will be 2.

The following graphs are valid only after performing the initial settings. After any changing of the settings, the following graphs are no longer valid.

### Drive Unit - Set Carrier Belt

Equipment Status

Program Step step zero

Special Equipment

Dynamometer, TP No. 74767-0102

**Note:** The carrier belt must be aligned before measuring.

To achieve correct belt tension, apply a force of 25-35N to the centre point of the belt. If the deflection distance is 6.5mm, the belt has the correct tension.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003130130.png)

The following method is a way to perform this setting.

2.  Make sure that the belt does not slack.
    
3.  Measure the distance **A** between the beam and the carrier belt, at the [Centre point](#CentrePointcentrePoint-CE228F5D).
    
4.  Calculate thickness **C** (subtract 6.5 from **A**).
    
5.  Find a feeler gauge with the calculated thickness **C**. Insert the feeler gauge between the carrier belt and the beam, at the [Centre point](#CentrePointcentrePoint-CE228F5D).
    
6.  Use a dynamo metre to apply a force of **25N** to **35N** at the [Centre point](#CentrePointcentrePoint-CE228F5D) of the carrier belt. When applying the force, the belt must be in contact with the feeler gauge, but the feeler gauge must be easy to remove.
    
7.  If adjustment is necessary, loosen the [Screw](#Screwscrews-CE234D82) and the [Lock nut](#LockNutlockNuts-CE2363B4) on both sides of the carrier belt. For Base machines, the [Screw](#Screwscrews-C49E9113) must also be loosened.
    
8.  Use the [Screw](#Screwscrews-CE236D1C) to adjust the carrier belt tension and then repeat item [Reference](MeasureTheDistanceABetweenTheBeamAn-0EFD6DAB) to [Reference](UseADynamoMeterToApplyAForceOf25NTo-0EFD7AAF).
    
9.  Make sure that the distance **B** is equal on both sides of the carrier belt.
    
    **Note:** The carrier belt must be aligned and must not wander.
    
10.  Tighten the [Screw](#Screwscrews-CE234D82), [Screw](#Screwscrews-C49E9113), and the [Lock nut](#LockNutlockNuts-CE2363B4).

### Pusher - Check

Equipment Status

Program Step

1.  Check for cracks or wear in the [Contact surface](#ContactSurfacecontactSurface-CE9E48DB). If required, change the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A) and check the overtravel of the pusher, see Procedure [Pusher - Set Overtravel](#section455) on page [Pusher - Set Overtravel](#section455).
    
2.  Check the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A) surfaces for even wear. If one of the ends shows signs of excessive wear, make sure the pusher pistons are set correctly, see Procedure [Erector - Basic Set](#section435) on page [Erector - Basic Set](#section435). The forming plates have to be aligned with the mandrels. See Procedure [Pusher - Align](#section456) on page [Pusher - Align](#section456). The [Linear guide](#LinearGuidelinearGuides-CE9E8FC1) have to be in line with the forming plates.
    
    **Note:** If the previous instructions do not permit the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A) to rest evenly and firmly in the forming plate, continue with the following.
    
3.  Check the [Pusher rod](#PusherRodpusherRod-CE9E73DE) and make sure that they are straight. This can be done by using a ruler or preferably on a diabase table.
    
    **Note:** Valid for Micro: it is also very important that the [Pusher piston support](#PusherPlungerSupportpusherPlungerSu-CE9E9AD7) is straight and in line with the [Pusher rod](#PusherRodpusherRod-CE9E73DE).

4.  Make sure the pusher piston slides effortless against the piston support. To check this, put the pusher piston in place using the bolts. Measure the distance **A** between the pusher piston and the piston support.
    

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000145007.png)

A (mm) = 0 -0/+0.4

5.  Mount the [Pusher rod](#PusherRodpusherRod-CE9E73DE) complete with the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A) and the [Spring](#Springsprings-CE9ED24D) on the [Linear sliding unit](#LinearSlidingUnitlinearSlidingUnit-CE9EDB62) using the screws but leaving out the [Front end shim](#FrontEndShimfrontEndShims-CE9EE7B3) and the  [Back end shim](#BackEndShimbackEndShims-CE9EF88C). Measure the distance **B** between the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A) in its front end and in its back end. The distance in the front end should be equal to or max. 0.2 mm, less than the distance in the back end. If this is not the case, the [Pusher rod](#PusherRodpusherRod-CE9E73DE) needs to be bent in the front end to achieve the correct distances described above.
    
6.  Remove the screws and put the [Front end shim](#FrontEndShimfrontEndShims-CE9EE7B3) and the [Back end shim](#BackEndShimbackEndShims-CE9EF88C) equal to the distance measured between the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A) and the forming plate. Add approximately 0.2 mm to the shims in the [Front end shim](#FrontEndShimfrontEndShims-CE9EE7B3) against the forming plate.

7.  Check the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A). It will now rest firmly against the forming plate and evenly between the front end and the back end. Slightly pull the [Pusher piston](#PusherPlungerpusherPlunger-CE9E5C8A) in its front end away from the forming plate and let it spring back. It should snap back and rest firmly to the surface of the forming plate.
    
8.  Check that the [Rod](#Rodrods-CE9F0E7F) are clean and free from paper/plastic residue.
    
9.  Check the [Rod](#Rodrods-CE9F0E7F) and the [Ball bushing](#BallBushingballBushings-CE9F1EAE) for excessive wear.

10.  Run the machine and check that the [Lid splice](#LidSplicelidSplice-CEB151F1), from tools on the lid, lines up with the [Packaging material crease](#PackagingMaterialCreasepackagingMat-CEB13AD2). If deviation, remove the same thickness of the [Shim 1](#Shim1shims1-CEB11B55) as the deviation, from one erector finger, and add the same thickness, under the other erector finger (Example: 0.5mm deviation = remove 0.5mm shims from one erector finger and add 0.5mm under the other). Run the machine and check again.
    
    **Note:** When changing the shims under the erector fingers, make sure that they never crash downwards or upwards into the forming plates.
    
    **Note:** Make sure that the [Bracket](#Bracketbracket-CEB16432) does not collide with the [Forming plate](#FormingPlateformingPlate-CEB19743). There must be a clearance between the [Bracket](#Bracketbracket-CEB16432) and the [Forming plate](#FormingPlateformingPlate-CEB19743), see arrow in illustration.

Cooling Water System
--------------------

### Functional Description

The cooling water system consists of three circuits: ice water from the customer cooling system, the internal cooling system and a separate internal cooling system for the **LFU**. It is important to follow the specifications in the **IM** to make the system function properly.

### Ice Water from the Customer Cooling System

Ice water is transported directly to the oil cooler in the [Hydraulic unit O202](#HydraulicUnitO202hydraulicUnitO202-CEBCD3D0) and the cooler in the [Electrical cabinet O207](#ElectricalCabinetO207electricalCabi-CEBCBBEE). Ice water is also transported in the primary circuit in the [Heat exchanger O203](#HeatExchangerO203heatExchangerO203-CEBCC489) and the [Heat exchanger O212](#HeatExchangerO212heatExchangerO212-CEBCCD9D), in the two internal systems.

The ice water used in the filling system is divided in two lines between S1 and S2. Each line has two units. In one unit, **HEPA** air cools the peroxide reducer, the tank breathing and the cleaning boxes. The other unit is in series with the first unit. It is an air cooler with **HEPA** air for the hygiene chamber.

*   Electrical cabinet O207
*   Heat exchanger O203
*   Hydraulic unit O202
*   Heat exchanger O212

### The Internal Cooling System

One group for TT/3 1900, and one for TT/3 2000.

*   the ovens and guides in the **ASU** and Carton Section.
    
*   the external and internal tools in the **LFU**.
    
*   the guides and **UV** lamps in the Package Section.
    

The cooling water flow is regulated by the flow meterA30P4331 to the flow meterA72Q2212.

The temperature is primarily regulated by an adjustable temperature regulating valve. The temperature regulating valve is sensitive to the temperature sensorA24B0202 of the outflow, on the secondary side of the heat exchanger. It regulates the flow of ice water on the primary side, depending on the measured temperature. It is of critical importance to keep the cooling water temperature constant for the internal and external tools. The temperature regulating valve has a pneumatically controlled on/off valve, pneumatic valveA24K0256/A66K0211, which is normally opened.

### Cooling Water System - Check Deionization Cartridge

Equipment Status

Program Step

1.  Check the [Electrical connection](#ElectricalConnectionelectricalConne-CEC0AF1E) for the deionization cartridge.
    
    **Note:** Make sure that the cable is properly connected to the sensing point.
    
2.  Check the **TPOP** for alarms -  [Deionization warning](#DeionizationWarningdeionizationWarn-CEC0DEEF).
    
3.  If necessary change the deionization cartridge. See Procedure [Cooling Water System - Change Deionization Cartridge](#section485) on page [Cooling Water System - Change Deionization Cartridge](#section485).
    
4.  To finish the production without the possibility to immediately change the deionization cartridge:
    
    *   Step the machine down to AIR ON. This will switch the alarm from yellow to blue, and another two hours of run time is possible.
        
        **Note:** In case of a yellow alarm the deionization cartridge must be changed. See Procedure on page .

### Cooling Water System - Set Cooling Temperature

Equipment Status

Program Step

The [Temperature regulator](#TemperatureRegulatortemperatureRegu-CEC15731), regulates the temperature for the cooling water. To ensure that cooling water temperature not drops too much, the [Valve actuator (F200)](#ValveActuatorF200valveActuatorF200-CEC15E3C), is built to shut down the cooling water outlet.

The [Valve actuator (F200)](#ValveActuatorF200valveActuatorF200-CEC15E3C) is normally open.

The [Valve actuator (F200)](#ValveActuatorF200valveActuatorF200-CEC15E3C) closes (= air pressure On), after that the temperature has dropped 1 °C from pre-set value.

The temperature of the regulator is set to one degree Celsius higher than on the **TPOP** to make the regulator precede the value of the **TPOP**.

*   Temperature regulator
*   Air hose
*   Valve actuator (F200)

1.  Set the cooling water temperature on the **TPOP** to 27 °C.
    
2.  Disconnect the [Air hose](#AirHoseairHose-CEC17A80) from the [Valve actuator (F200)](#ValveActuatorF200valveActuatorF200-CEC15E3C).
    
    **Note:** If the [Air hose](#AirHoseairHose-CEC17A80) is connected, the PLC will try to close the [Valve actuator (F200)](#ValveActuatorF200valveActuatorF200-CEC15E3C), when the temperature is falling, and therefore make it impossible to adjust the temperature on the [Temperature regulator](#TemperatureRegulatortemperatureRegu-CEC15731).
    
3.  When both lines are in production, adjust the [Temperature regulator](#TemperatureRegulatortemperatureRegu-CEC15731), until the temperature is stable, 28 °C.
    
4.  Connect the [Air hose](#AirHoseairHose-CEC17A80) to the [Valve actuator (F200)](#ValveActuatorF200valveActuatorF200-CEC15E3C).

Hydraulic System
----------------

Hydraulic Unit
--------------

### Functional Description

The power generating part of the unit consists of a 7.5 kW [Electrical motor](#ElectricalMotorelectricalMotor-CF21E36C) and a variable displacement [Pump](#Pumppump-CF21F2BD). The maximum continuous flow is 26 l/min at 1450 r/min. The displacement is controlled by the consumption of oil so that the flow at every moment is just enough to maintain the set pressure. The maximum pressure is set to 160 bar and a sealed overflow valve is set to 210 bar and has a maximum flow of

28 l/minute.

The pump is connected to a 70 litre stainless steel [Tank](#Tanktank-CF21EC88). The tank contains of a [Level glass](#LevelGlasslevelGlass-CF21DF4D), an analogue [Temperature gauge](#TemperatureGaugetemperatureGauge-CF21D30B), and a level sensor with two alarm levels. The first starts an audible alarm, the second stops the machine.

*   Temperature gauge
*   Level glass
*   Tank
*   Electrical motor
*   Pump

As the maximum instantaneous flow consumption is considerably higher than 26 l/minute there is an [Accumulator](#Accumulatoraccumulator-CF2253B0) on the pressure side. When the instantaneous flow is higher than 26 l/minute the accumulator supports the flow. When the instantaneous flow is lower than 26 l/minute the accumulator is recharged until it reaches full pressure. The accumulator, which is a bladder type, has a volume of 10 litres and is pre-loaded on the gas side to 120 bar.

The hydraulic power unit contains another flow circuit for filtration and cooling. This consists of a 15 l/minute pump powered by a 0.18 kW [Electrical motor](#ElectricalMotorelectricalMotor-CF225FA0). The filtration and cooling circuit is on continuously as long as the hydraulic power unit is on. The flow passes through a [Heat exchanger](#HeatExchangerheatExchanger-CF2268E1) where the cooling agent is dairy ice water. A temperature sensor in the circuit, before the heat exchanger, controls (on or off) the ice water flow. After the heat exchanger there is a [Filter](#Filterfilter-CF22754D) including a filter guard. The guard activates an alarm if the filter is clogged and needs to be replaced.

This extra pump circuit can also be used to fill up and to empty the tank with hydraulic oil. A special hose is included for this.

The hydraulic power unit contains the pump and tank unit for the [Central lubrication](#CentralLubricationcentralLubricatio-CF22820B).

### Hydraulic Unit - Check Pressure Drop

Equipment Status

Program Step

When a safety door is opened while the hydraulic pump is running, the hydraulic pressure must rapidly drop to zero. This safety function is monitored by pressure switch A24B0204.

#### Fault-finding

1.  During operation: Alarm and indication on the **TPOP**.
    
    *   No signal is received from pressure switch A24B0204.
        
    *   Action: Replace the pressure switch.
        
2.  Fault after stopping the machine: Alarm and indication on the **TPOP**.
    
    *   The pressure must drop below 1.5 MPa within 3 seconds of stopping.
        
    *   A signal is still being received from pressure switch A24B0204.
        
    *   Action: Check the door safety switch.
        

#### Checking

1.  Open one of the safety doors and check on the pressure gauge that the pressure drops rapidly to zero. A slight knock must be heard from the accumulator after roughly one second when the membrane hits the end section.
    
2.  If the hydraulic pressure is low with the safety door closed:
    
    *   Trace for possible electrical faults.
        
    *   Check the hydraulic pump.
        

### Hydraulic Unit - Check Oil Quality

Equipment Status

Program Step step ZERO

Special Equipment

Sampling valve TP No. 1590255-0000

Consumables

Food Grade Hydraulic Oil: TP No. 1607001-0000  
(valid from machine 63202/20067 or for machines with UK-3355833-0100)  
Hydraulic Oil: TP No. 344474-4603  
(valid for machines up to 63202/20066, without UK-3355833-0100)

#### Oil requirement

To avoid unnecessary and unplanned stops in the hydraulic system, it is important to always maintain a high oil quality. Tetra Pak suggests in this instruction a way to handle this.

It is not always enough to change the oil within a specified period. Tetra Pak also recommends a test of the oil even if it has been recently changed. This is to make it possible to find faults as overheating and water impairing before it causes a breakdown. See instructions below.

The oil must be tested due to particle contamination and water impairing. The oil must correspond to (or be better):

4.  ISO 4406:1999, 19/16/13 or SAE AS 4059 (similar to older NAS 1638), class 7.
    
5.  Water impairing must be maximum 200 ppm (= 0.02%).
    
6.  If there is a larger amount of water in the oil, it is possible to detect it by the methods described in Check of oil quality. However the oil can contain up to 600 ppm (0.06%) water without it being noticeable for the eye. The only way to detect this is with an laboratory test.
    

#### Oil Test

To get an oil test performed, contact for example HYDAC (www.hydac.com) and order equipment to take the oil sample.

Tetra Pak suggests the oil analyse PVM-MVA-WA 1279078, which provides you with the following analyses:

1/ Microscope impurity analyse

2/ Water content (K. Fisher) Coulomat

3/ Particle counting

When an oil sample is taken and sent to HYDAC, the “Oil Sampling Record “on the next page must be completed. The record is also delivered with the oil sample equipment.

As a test an oil sample was sent to HYDAC by Tetra Pak.

#### Oil Check

Check: Drain some oil every six months and perform a check according to the flowchart below. About how to drain, see the following pages. For every other check (= once a year) send an oil sample for analyse.

**Note:** If the oil turns out to be impaired, follow the instructions in , to find the fault and repair it.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000364162.svg)

#### Check of Oil Quality

Type of Check

Analyse Description

Action

Oil Status

Check the oil visually and compare the smell of the old oil with new oil of the same type and brand. If the old oil looks and smells like the new oil it is usually in good condition.

1/ If the oil smells or looks bad, change oil. See Procedure [Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil](#section499).

2/ Run the machine for a month. Send thereafter an oil sample for analyse.

Overheated Oil

Overheated oil is dark (= brown) and smells burnt (= bad smell).

1/ Try to find out why the hydraulic oil has been overheated, and make action to protect from further overheating.

2/ Change oil. See Procedure [Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil](#section499).

Water or Air Impairing in Oil

If the oil is “cloudy” (= white), it indicates that the oil contains a lot of water or air.

Water Detection

To find out if there is water in the oil use one (or both) of these methods:

1/ Perform a “crackle test”: Pour a sample of the oil in a large spoon. Heat the spoon from the underside (by a cigarette lighter). If there is water in the oil it will start boiling and crackles.

2/ Take an oil sample in a glass and let “rest” for a while. If there is water in the bottom, it is obvious what caused the impairing.

Air Detection

If there is no water according to items above, “whiteness” is due to air.

Another sign for air in the oil is a not properly working system. With to much air mixed in, the oil system will “swing” and probably cause an odd behaviour in the LFU. There can also be cavitation noise (slam from the pump).

**Whiteness due to water:**

Try to find out why the oil is impaired with water. Some causes are listed below:

\- A faulty heat exchanger.

\- Water has pierced into the tank during cleaning.

\- Condense.

The **oil must be changed** to protect the system from unnecessary wear and corrosion.

Do as follows:

1/ Let the hydraulic unit “rest” for a while. Evacuate the water by draining the oil tank until oil comes out. See Procedure [Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil](#section499).

2/ Run the hydraulic unit.

3/ Change oil. See Procedure [Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil](#section499).

**Whiteness due to air:**

\- Low oil level in tank - Fill it up.

\- Air leakage somewhere in the hydraulic system. Probably in the suction pipe for the hydraulic pump

\- Try to trace and repair.

#### How to Drain for an Oil Sample

1.  Connect the [Sampling valve](#SamplingValvesamplingValve-CF25D7CB) to the [Test point](#TestPointtestPoint-CF25EC34): A30K1229 (S1) or A30K2229 (S2).
    
2.  Start up the hydraulic unit on low pressure. See Procedure [LFU Remote Control - Handle](#section748).
    
3.  Drain out approximately 0.5litres of oil, before filling up the bottle for the oil sample.
    
    **Note:** It is very important to drain at least 0.5litres. This is to clean the [Sampling valve](#SamplingValvesamplingValve-CF25D7CB) from foreign particles.
    
4.  Remove the [Sampling valve](#SamplingValvesamplingValve-CF25D7CB) from the [Test point](#TestPointtestPoint-CF25EC34).

Central Lubrication
-------------------

### Functional Description

The central lubrication system uses a piston pump driven with compressed air. In order to operate correctly the system must be free from air. The lubricant is fed from the central lubrication pump through the main line, distribution blocks and to the dosing valves in the dosing blocks. From here the lubricant is independently dosed with a set quantity, to each lubrication point in the system. The pump keeps the lubricant under pressure for a short while during each lubrication cycle. The system is then decompressed to a pressure of approximately 2-5 bar. The residual pressure is important since a too high pressure does not give any refilling of the dosing valves and if there is no residual pressure, air might enter the system.

The lubrication cycle runs every 15 minutes. The first 40 seconds of the cycle the pump is pressurising the system. By 38-40 seconds of the lubrication cycle the pressure in the system is checked by means of the pressure switch in the front of the machine. From the 51 second to the end of the lubrication cycle it is checked that the pressure switch is not activated. Thus it is verified that the pressure switch is working and is not short circuted.

The system can also be activated from the TPOP to run an intense lubrication cycle e.g. when bleeding the system. See Procedure [Central Lubrication - Force Lubrication through TPOP](#section511).

### Central Lubrication Unit - Check

Equipment Status

Program Step

The pressure during the lubrication pulses must be 5-6 MPa (50-60 bar). The pressure is shown by the [Pressure gauge](#PressureGaugepressureGauge-CF34DB0E). The residual pressure between pulses must be 0.2-0.5 MPa (2-5 bar).

The [Pressure switch](#PressureSwitchpressureSwitch-CF34E410) is located in the machine front.

In case of alarm for low lubrication pressure, check the system for leakage.

Peroxide Unit
-------------

### Functional Description

The package disinfection process in the TT/3 filling machine is based on vaporised hydrogen peroxide and UV-light. The hydrogen peroxide vapour condensates and forms a thin layer on the inside of the packaging material, and it has a strong germicidal effect when illuminated by the UV-lamp. When handling hydrogen peroxide take care to read the Section Hydrogen Peroxide in the Chapter ii Safety Precaution.

The hydrogen peroxide system in the filling machine variant **XH** sprays vaporised hydrogen peroxide on the inside of the package just as it enters the hygiene chamber. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) used in the filling machine variant **XH** is diluted to a concentration of 3%.

The hydrogen peroxide system in the filling machine variants **AD**, **ADY**, **ASD**, **ASCM**, and **AW** sprays vaporised hydrogen peroxide on the packaging material web before it is cut in to blanks. This is a pre-treatment of the inside of the packaging material. The sleeve is then formed and provided with a lid. The inside of the package is sprayed again just as it enters the hygiene chamber. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) used in the filling machine variants **AD**, **ADY**, **ASD**, **ASCM**, and **AW** is diluted to a concentration of 3%.

*   One tank (valid for **XH**) or two tanks (valid for **AD**, **ASD**, **ASCM** and **AW**).
    
*   Two pumps (valid for **XH**) or four pumps (valid for **AD**, **ASD**, **ASCM** and **AW**). Two pumps for pre-treatment (valid for **AD**, **ADY**, **ASD**, **ASCM**, and **AW**) and two for package disinfection.
    
*   One panel used for monitoring the flow to the pre-treatment evaporator (valid for **AD**, **ADY**, **SD**, **ASCM**, and Water). One panel used for monitoring the flow to the package disinfection evaporator.
    
*   One pre-treatment evaporator and pressure switches (valid for **AD**, **ADY**, **ASD**, **ASCM**, and **AW**), and one package disinfection evaporator and pressure switches.

Hydrogen peroxide is stored in the [](#Tanktanks-CF3E377C)located in the **ASU**. The tank can easily be removed from the TT/3 filling machine as the tank has a [](#Quick-couplingquick-coupling-CF3E64AE). The tank has a built-in [](#LevelSensorlevelSensor-CF3E763A)and is vented to atmosphere.

The table shows the number of production hours before the tank(s) needs to be refilled, if both sides are in production at the same time. It also gives information about when the low-level alarm (a blue alarm on the **TPOP**) will go off, informing the operator how many minutes that are left before the tank is empty.

The tubing from the [Quick-connection](#QuickConnectionquickConnection-CF3EB60A) is divided into two, one for Side 1 and one for Side 2. Each side has an electrically driven peristaltic [Pump](#Pumppump-CF3ED11A). The rotation speed is controlled by an analogue signal of 0 to 4 VDC. The rotation speed of the pumps, and thus the hydrogen peroxide flows, are set by the operator from the **TPOP**. When installing a new pump or changing the tubing, the spring tension of the [Spring loaded tension arm](#SpringLoadedTensionArmspringLoadedT-CF3F0A4E) has to be set. This is done by turning a [Setting screw](#SettingScrewsettingScrew-CF3F1151). Adjusting the spring loaded tension arm to set the peroxide flow is not recommended. The hydrogen peroxide is pumped to the [Spray body](#SprayBodysprayBody-CF3F1808) at the evaporator.

The hydrogen peroxide flow and the air flow can be visually monitored on the [Panel](#Panelpanel-CF3F26EE). It includes [Filter](#Filterfilters-CF3F3261) and four flow meters. The hydrogen peroxide [Flow meter, H2O2](#FlowMeterH2O2flowMetersH2O2-CF3F4889) are used for visually monitoring the H2O2 flows. The [Flow meter, air](#FlowMeterAirflowMetersAir-CF3F5358) are used for visually monitoring and adjusting the air flows. The panel includes an adjustable [Regulator](#Regulatorregulator-CF3F5B89) that regulates the system air pressure. From the panel the air is divided and distributed to the [Spray body](#SprayBodysprayBody-CF3F62E7) on Side 1 and Side 2.

If the [Heater](#Heaterheater-CF3F6A29) is heated up without the air flow it will brake. The air comes from the [Valve](#Valvevalve-CF3F710C) which is normally open. If there is a power failure or the coil to the valve has broken, the air will still flow through the spray bodies and heaters to protect them from damage.

At the [Peroxide unit](#PeroxideUnitperoxideUnit-CF3F854F) the peroxide and air flow is monitored by the [Pressure switch, H2O2](#PressureSwitchH2O2pressureSwitchH2O-CF3F9746) and the [Pressure switch, air](#PressureSwitchAirpressureSwitchAir-CF3F9ECC). The [Spray body](#SprayBodysprayBody-CF3FA514) has a built in needle that can be used to clear the nozzle if it has become clogged.

Peroxide and air is atomised in the spray body and the mixture is then vaporised in the [Heater](#Heaterheaters-CF3FBCCA). The temperature in the heater is controlled by a [Thermocouple](#Thermocouplethermocouple-CF3FC31A). Monitoring and adjusting of the temperature levels is done by the operator from the **TPOP**.

The vaporised hydrogen peroxide air in the unit for pre-treatment is lead through the hose and out the peroxide spray nozzles in the [Pre-treatment box](#Pre-treatmentBoxpre-treatmentBox-CF3FCD3D). The vaporised hydrogen peroxide air in the unit for package disinfection is lead through pipe into the hygiene chamber and out through the peroxide [Spray nozzle](#SprayNozzlesprayNozzles-CF3FD8CD) into the packages. The flow of hydrogen peroxide air mixture is constant.

The spray unit contains a check valve to protect from uncontrolled drainage of hydrogen peroxide while the air is flowing through the spray body and the nozzles. The check valve is not adjustable.

### Functional Description

A [Servomotor](#Servomotorservomotor-CFBCDCDC) drives the cam module for cutting and folding, and the curve unit. The motor is equipped with a brake to prevent unintentional movement by hand. The brake also prevents movement if energy is built up in the system when the servomotor power is cut after the doors are opened, for instance spring force from the pusher or from mechanical parts after a crash.

The machine can not be cranked by hand. All movements must be made by the control panel.

The control of the servomotors is synchronised with the rest of the machine by the **PLC** system.

The servomotor drives a [Planetary gear (PV10)](#PlanetaryGearPV10planetaryGearPV10-CFBCE7AB) 4:1, which drives a [Worm gear (SV5)](#WormGearSV5wormGearSV5-CFBCF06D) 7.25:1. The reason for the two gear solution is that if all of the gear ratio were done by the worm gear, it would become self-locking. If there is too prompt a stop of the servomotor, the self-locking could damage the worm gear. Another reason is that a higher gear change results in a lower efficiency with more heat released as a consequence.

*   Servomotor
*   Planetary gear (PV10)

In the rear section of the machine, the [Worm gear (SV5)](#WormGearSV5wormGearSV5-CFBCF06D) drives a [Bevel gear (VV9)](#BevelGearVV9bevelGearVV9-CFBD27E2) with gear ratio 1:1. On the two [Output shaft](#OutputShaftoutputShafts-CFBD43F1), there is one cam for cutting functions and one for folding functions.

Ahead in the machine the worm gear drives a [Bevel gear (VV7)](#BevelGearVV7bevelGearVV7-CFBD5F02) with gear ratio 1:1. It has only one [Output shaft](#OutputShaftoutputShaft-CFBDA811) which drives the curve unit, also called record player or jukebox.

Between the worm gear and the [Bevel gear (VV7)](#BevelGearVV7bevelGearVV7-CFBD5F02) there is an [Overload clutch](#OverloadClutchoverloadClutch-CFBD759E) that releases at 400 Nm. The normal torque is 220-250 Nm during PRODUCTION. The overload clutch can only be engaged in one position and with that the synchronization is maintained. A proximity switch senses when the clutch has released and stops the machine.

The [Worm gear (SV5)](#WormGearSV5wormGearSV5-CFBCF06D), and the [Bevel gear (VV7)](#BevelGearVV7bevelGearVV7-CFBD5F02) and the [Bevel gear (VV9)](#BevelGearVV9bevelGearVV9-CFBD27E2) have sensors for the oil levels.

During operation so is the oil not checked because of the risk for false alarms due to that the oil is tossed around in the gears.

The oil level is checked one minute after every operation, if the oil level is low a blue alarm will occur. The blue alarm turns to a yellow alarm after one more hour of operation and then it is not possible to continue operation without filling oil.

The [Planetary gear (PV10)](#PlanetaryGearPV10planetaryGearPV10-CFBCE7AB) is filled with grease.

### Functional Description

The sprue remover unit is placed on the conveyor and removes the sprue from the top of the packages before the cap is assembled. A belt brake is used to transport the package in the conveyor direction and support the package through the sprue remover unit.

With a [Belt](#Beltbelt-6E467316) and a [Wheel](#Wheelwheel-6E48D60A), the sprue remover unit pulls the sprue perpendicular to the movement direction of the package. The sprue is pulled off, transported to the drop chute, and gathered in the collection box at the outfeed side of the sprue remover unit.

For a description of other types of Sprue removers, see [Functional Description](#section616).

### Functional Description

The Lid Forming Unit (**LFU**) forms and fits a lid with an opening device at the top of the Tetra Top package.

In the following pages, a short description is given of the path of the plastic through the **LFU**.

**The Colour Feed and the Transfer Unit**

In the [Colour feed](#ColourFeedcolourFeed-DD92F94D), the [Coloured granulate](#ColouredGranulatecolouredGranulate-DD92F94D) is fed into the [Transparent PE granulate](#TransparentPEGranulatetransparentPE-DD92F94D) by a [Cylinder](#Cylindercylinder-DD92F94D). Depending on the lid design the programme controls the frequency for the valve.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000193318.png)

*   Coloured granulate
*   **PE** granulateTransparent

*   Colour feed
*   Cylinder

The quantity of plastic in the [Accumulator](#Accumulatoraccumulator-DD92F94D) is controlled by the speed of the [Screw](#Screwscrew-DD92F94D). The screw rotates continuously at high speed or at low speed. When the accumulator is empty, the screw moves at high speed. When the accumulator is half full with plastic, the screw moves at lower speed. The screw stops when the accumulator is full The transfer unit only operates when the machine is in running position.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000193317.png)

*   Accumulator
*   Screw

**Hot Channel Unit**

The plastic is transferred from the accumulator to the [Injection cylinder](#InjectionCylinderinjectionCylinders-DD9361FD) through a heated [Hose](#Hosehose-DD9361FD).

There is a [Non-return valve](#Non-returnValvenon-returnValve-DD9361FD) in the hot channel unit. When the injection cylinder is off, the plastic pressure returns to the cylinder piston. The stroke length of the injection cylinder can be adjusted by a [Stop screw](#StopScrewstopScrew-DD9361FD). The amount of plastic, called the dose, depends on the stroke length.

The needle valve is kept closed by a [Spring](#Springspring-DD9361FD) in a [Pneumatic cylinder](#PneumaticCylinderpneumaticCylinder-DD9361FD). When the injection starts the pneumatic is shut off and due to the plastic pressure the non-return valve is closed and the [Needle](#Needleneedle-DD9361FD) is opened by the plastic pressure.

**Identification of Hot Channel Piston Versions**

The main difference between the Hot Channel Pistons is the cooling body attached to the Pistons in version With Cooling. The different versions are illustrated in this Section.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002705496.png)

Hot Channel Piston Version Without Cooling

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002705495.png)

Hot Channel Piston Version With Cooling

**Piston unit (Valid for Hot Channel Version with Cooling)**

To reduce the plastic leakage, a unit with a [Cylinder](#Cylindercylinder-E526470E) and a [Piston](#Pistonpiston-E5264AA3) is made with a specific gap, in the combination with a [Cooling body](#CoolingBodycoolingBody-E5264EAF) results in a controlled plastic leakage. It’s possible to change the piston unit without changing the entire Hot Channel.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002705494.png)

*   Cylinder
*   Piston

**Needle (Valid for Hot Channel Piston Version with Cooling)**

A needle unit with a [Bushing](#Bushingbushing-E591A514) and a [Needle](#Needleneedle-E5919E68) are matched to each other.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002706487.png)

*   Bushing
*   Needle

**Cooling circuit for Hot Channel Piston (Valid for Hot Channel Piston Version with Cooling)**

The cooling circuits purpose is to cool the plastic between the piston and the cylinder in order to not leak as liquid plastic. This is done with a water [Cooling body](#CoolingBodycoolingBody-E5264EAF) on the cylinder and in a parallel a glycol circuit with a separate [Flow meter](#FlowMeterflowMeter-E5270AA3). During stand still there is a pulse function that switches the water valve on and off to prevent plastic to freeze around the pistons.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002706486.png)

*   Flow meter

**Movement of the External Tools**

A servomotor and a hydraulic cylinder with two areas determine the movement of the external tools. The small area on the hydraulic cylinder is for the movement when the cylinder works together with the accumulator. The accumulator empties when the tools close and charges when the tools are open e.g. brake action.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000193314.png)

The illustration shows the small area

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000193313.png)

The illustration shows the big area

**Accumulator**

The accumulator is a diaphragm membrane accumulator with an air connection on the non- hydraulic side. The air pressure is controlled by a regulator and a non-return valve.

When the air pressure is below the set pressure, i.e., when the air volume is as big as possible, air is filled up through the regulator and the non-return valve.

To avoid building up an over pressure on the accumulator’s oil side, the accumulator is bled through a small restrictor and a non-return valve. To make sure that there is correct pressure on the oil side, the accumulator is recharged once every cycle. This is done when the oil volume is maximum and is controlled by a directional valve. The recharging is done through a non-return valve and a pressure regulator.

**Lock**

During the closing of the tools, the pneumatically controlled [Lock](#Locklock-DD93FBD9) activates. The lock closes when it passes the [Recess](#Recessrecess-DD93FBD9) on the [Horizontal force shaft](#HorizontalForceShafthorizontalForce-DD93FBD9). The sensor gives a signal and the hydraulically controlled [Horizontal force cylinder](#HorizontalForceCylinderhorizontalFo-DD93FBD9) activates to keep the halves of the external tools together.

**Distance Cylinder**

The distance cylinder keeps the external tools and the hot channels apart at the opening and closing of the tools.

**Tightness**

The big area of the vertical force cylinder activates at low pressure, about 9 bar, to tighten between the hot channel and the tools.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000193313.png)

**Injection**

The injection cylinders activate and inject plastic into the cavity. There are sensors for full and empty cylinder.

**Pressing**

When the injection cylinder is empty the sensors activate pressing e.g. the big area and high pressure on the vertical cylinder. The pressure is controlled by a proportional valve.

The plastic cools down and pressing is done. Tightness releases and the horizontal force cylinder releases. The lock opens and the external tools open.

**Reference Cylinders**

The reference cylinders open the cavity at the injection. The reference cylinders are activated when the first lids are produced at start up. During a safety stop the length of the cylinder can be set when the cylinder is in deactivated position.

### Identification of Tool/Mandrel/Lid

**Note:** The type/amount of identification may vary depending of the lid. Some have less than below described (short of room for engraving or plug).

An example: 2:2 / 4 = Side 2:2, mandrel no 4.

### Alarm 110303661/110303662 “Hydraulic Accumulator Wrong Pressure”

**Description**

The hydraulic accumulator supports the servomotor in the tool movement.

The air pressure in the accumulator is recharged over a non-return valve by pneumatic air to 2.8-3.0bar and then by hydraulic oil, recharged to 13bar.

The accumulator air pressure varies during the cycle due to the volume change of oil in the accumulator, open or closed tools.

In the cycle, when tools are opened, the recharge valve opens for a short time to obtain the pressure balance between the pneumatic air and the hydraulic oil in the accumulator. This is to compensate the bleeding.

Bleeding is always on to avoid overfilling of oil due to the position change of the logic element.

To detect a hydraulic overload by oil volume, the hydraulic pressure is supervised by the [Pressure switch](#PressureSwitchpressureSwitch-10FA8BB0). With the tools closed, the accumulator unit is almost empty of oil. The hydraulic pressure is then normally 2-3bar.

**Conditions to Set the Alarm**

The alarm will be set if there is a higher hydraulic pressure than 8bar in the accumulation unit during pressing at the sector value 500-1000. The normal value is 2 bar to 3bar.

When this alarm appears, the machine performs an Empty Package Stop and steps down to Heating.

PE drop at LS inside of a Tetra Top package
-------------------------------------------

Important information about the PE drop at the LS
-------------------------------------------------

### Background

The PE drop at LS (plastic flash) that can be seen inside the package is a natural part of the Tetra Top package design. The drop is caused by tolerances and safety precautions that are set so that the packaging material is not punctured when double material gets squeezed between the outer and inner tools.

The input for the safety margins (LS compensation in tool) is:

*   The tolerance of the material web reel
    
*   The sleeve tolerance when sealing
    
*   The sleeve rotation when putting the sleeve into position for lid forming
    

The tools are designed to compensate for all the tolerances and ensure that the packaging material is not punctured.

Due to the fact that LS overlap will vary from reel to reel the LS clearance for the tool has to be large enough for the largest LS without puncturing the sleeve. The PE drop is caused when the LS width on the sleeve is smaller than the LS clearance.

### Size of the PE drop

Because of the huge variety of the different top designs and sizes it is impossible to say what size and appearance the PE drop must have. As long as the machine can strip the package from the mandrels the PE drop is small enough.

The PE drop is needed to produce safe packages with maintained package integrity. As long as the packages pass the destructive and blue ink package integrity checks according to OM – Package Check, the PE drop is large enough.

### Factors that influence the PE drop size

### Lid Thickness

The lid thickness depends on the plastic dosing and pressing pressure. Increasing the plastic dosing without changing the pressing pressure will result in a thicker lid. Decreasing the plastic dosing without changing the pressing pressure it will result in a thinner lid.

The plastic dosing together with the pressing pressure also affects the shape and size of the PE drop.

By increasing or decreasing the plastic dosing and at the same time increasing or decreasing the pressing pressure the shape and size of the PE drop and the lid thickness will change.

**Note:** Going outside of the specified limits of lid thickness will create problems with integrity, capping, heat and stability.

### Package material

The width of the reel can differ from reel to reel, while staying within the tolerance of the packaging material. This makes the LS overlap slightly larger or smaller. A smaller LS overlap creates a bigger PE drop.

### Pressing pressure on LFU

The pressing pressure is used to press the plastic into the moulding tool cavity. A higher pressing pressure can make the PE drop larger, and a lower pressure can make it smaller. The values in the MM are default values and can be adjusted in order to optimise the performance. Approximately a ±10% change can be used if all other settings are OK and the package functionality is OK.

**Note:** The pressing pressure will directly affect the lid thickness. A smaller pressing pressure will make the lid thicker but also increase the risk of the plastic does not cover the sleeve completely or holes in the lid.

### Sleeve top circumference

The sleeve top circumference affects the LS overlap which then affects the plastic flash. A smaller sleeve top circumference causes a bigger LS overlap and a smaller PE drop.

**Note:** An incorrect sleeve size will seriously affect the package integrity and performance of the machine.

### Mechanical setting of LFU and tools

Incorrect mechanical settings can influence the PE drop in both directions. LFU and tools must be set according to the MM.

Position of the PE drop
-----------------------

Factors that influence the PE drop position
-------------------------------------------

### Crease position

The crease position set by the operator directly affects the position of the PE drop. If the crease is moved to the left in the ASU the PE drop will move to the left side of the LS as seen from the inside of the package.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000861549.png)

**Note:** The positioning of the crease is something the operator check and change often due to the factory creasing position on the package material. There is only one setting for this and that is in the centre of the K crease in the bottom of the package. If this is out of position it will affect the bottom and flap sealing of the package.

### Sleeve rotation on the mandrel

The sleeve rotation on the mandrel will affect the position of the PE drop. There is only one setting for this and that is that the crease on the sleeve must be aligned with the centre of the outer moulding tools.

**Note:** If the sleeve position on the mandrel is incorrect, a basic setting of the erector unit is needed.

#### Positioning

In the front of and the side of the frame (see arrows in illustration) there are engraved figures. The figures come from a check of the frame against the drawing specification.

A deviation from the nominal measure at each measuring point, results in an engraved figure in the frame. If the measuring spot is on the nominal value, the engraving is **0**.

**When to use**

To set the vertical guide to a correct position, the bars must be set to the nominal value against the measuring surfaces. The value that is measured must be compensated with the marked deviation when setting the vertical guide. The engraved marking is the deviation from ±0 and is a factory set value.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0004296192.png)

1.  Measure the distances **A, B, C,** and **D** with a [Deep gauge](#DeepGaugedeepGauge-A01108F2).
    
    Engraved values on the frame can be specified in two different ways, for example: -16 or -0.16: Both values mean -0.16 mm.
    
    Negative engraved values mean the surface on the frame is below nominal value.
    
    Positive engraved values mean the surface on the frame is above nominal value.
    
2.  Compensation: Measured setting value should be compensated with the engraved value.
    
    *   **Example no. 1:** Engraved -0.16 must be added as 0.16 to the measured value.
        
    *   **Example no. 2:** Engraved 0.10 must reduce the measured value by 0.10.

6.  Measure A lower. Add or reduce the engraved value.
    
7.  Measure C lower. Add or reduce the engraved value.
    
    *   The difference between the compensated values A lower and C lower should be within tolerance ±0.05, to make mechanism parallel to the mandrel shaft.
        
8.  Measure D front upper. Add or reduce the engraved value.
    
9.  Measure D front lower. Add or reduce the engraved value.

If the run-out tolerance is more than the recommended it can affect the bearing installation and the sealings in the [Connection](#Connectionconnection-CC5C58A6) with a water leakage as a result. Therefore it is advisable to aim for a run-out as low as possible.

If the run-out tolerance is more than recommended, do as follows:

3.  Increase the torque on one or more of the [Screw](#Screwscrews-E239F879), meanwhile check the measuring instrument if the run-out tolerance is affected.
    
    Nominal torque is **22 Nm**, not more than **25 Nm** is recommended.
    
4.  If this does not work, loosen all the [Screw](#Screwscrews-E239F879) and tighten them with different torque until the run-out tolerance is as low as possible.
    
    This technique can lead to a torque for one or more of the [Screw](#Screwscrews-E239F879) to be beneath **22 Nm**, secure those [Screw](#Screwscrews-E239F879) with **Loctite 243**.

### Description

The extruder motor runs at two different speeds determined by the level of plastic in the plastic accumulator. The level is supervised by the [Inductive sensor (upper)](#InductiveSensorupperinductiveSensor-E5D7A990) and the [Inductive sensor (lower)](#InductiveSensorlowerinductiveSensor-E5D7AF84).

When the **LFU** is running continuously the extruder motor is supposed to run mainly in low speed mode, occasionally changing to high speed mode (every second or third injection).

Problems with the extruder motor will be indicated by a common alarm, displayed as “`F/C FEEDER MOTOR OVERLOAD`” on the **TPOP** panel. This alarm can be the result of mechanical and/or electrical overload, as well as if the extruder motor has been running continuously at high speed for more than 30 seconds. The latter is to indicate a blocked or limited granulate flow into the extruder or a leakage of plastic after the extruder.

If the "low" speed of the extruder is set too high, the extruder will not switch to "high" speed as intended. Then there is a risk that the alarm "`F/C FEEDER MOTOR OVERLOAD`" will not be set if a heated hose breaks.

*   Plastic accumulator
*   Inductive sensor (upper)
*   Inductive sensor (lower)

If the [Plastic accumulator](#PlasticAccumulatorPlasticAccumulato-E5D7C6DD) hits the mechanical stop when it is filled, and the extruder does not stop in time, a high pressure peak can be created in the heated hose.

The pictures below show the three different stages of the [Plastic accumulator](#PlasticAccumulatorPlasticAccumulato-E5D7C6DD) function.

**(A)** The [Plastic accumulator](#PlasticAccumulatorPlasticAccumulato-E5D7C6DD) is full. The [Inductive sensor (upper)](#InductiveSensorupperinductiveSensor-E5D7A990) and [Inductive sensor (lower)](#InductiveSensorlowerinductiveSensor-E5D7AF84) are both activated and stops the extruder motor. No plastic is fed to the plastic accumulator.

**(B)** One [Inductive sensor (upper)](#InductiveSensorupperinductiveSensor-E5D7A990) (the upper sensor), is activated and sets the low speed to the extruder motor. Plastic is continuously fed to the plastic accumulator.

**(C)** The [Plastic accumulator](#PlasticAccumulatorPlasticAccumulato-E5D7C6DD) is empty. None of the sensors are activated. This sets high speed to the extruder motor. Plastic is fed up to the [Plastic accumulator](#PlasticAccumulatorPlasticAccumulato-E5D7C6DD).

#### Check

For more information about the transfer unit, see [Description](#section824) on page [Description](#section824).

*   Check the air pressure for the [Plastic accumulator](#PlasticAccumulatorPlasticAccumulato-E5D7C6DD), see [Hydraulic and Pneumatic Pressures LFU - Record](#section925) on page [Hydraulic and Pneumatic Pressures LFU - Record](#section925).
    
*   Check the setting of the [Inductive sensor (upper)](#InductiveSensorupperinductiveSensor-E5D7A990) and [Inductive sensor (lower)](#InductiveSensorlowerinductiveSensor-E5D7AF84), see [Transfer Unit - Set Inductive Sensors](#section828) on page [Transfer Unit - Set Inductive Sensors](#section828).

*   Plastic accumulator
*   Inductive sensor (upper)
*   Inductive sensor (lower)

#### Set low speed

Fine adjustments must be performed for every individual unit. See section [Settings](#section922) on page [Settings](#section922) for basic setting values.

When the frequency for low speed is set correctly, the extruder motor works mainly in low speed mode and occasionally change to high speed mode (not to stop). The ideal setting is if the motor works continuously at low speed without interruptions.

*   Step the machine up to production.
    
*   Make sure that the two sensors are not activated. If they are, the extruder works with an over capacity and regulates between low speed and stop, which causes unnecessary high stress on the motor and gearbox.
    
*   If necessary, decrease the frequency for low speed.
    

#### Set high speed

The frequency for high speed mode must be approximately 20% higher than the low speed frequency. The setting of the high speed is most critical the first time, after the machine has been stepped down to out of heating.

*   Step the machine up to production.
    
*   Observe the accumulator and the sensors during the first ten **LFU** cycles. If the accumulator at any time reaches the upper mechanical stop (the plastic accumulator is empty), the frequency for high speed must be increased.
    
*   If necessary, increase the frequency for high speed.

Damaged threads and surfaces require a higher torque than recommended (45Nm). A higher torque than recommended can result in a twisted heating hose and reduce the lifetime of the heating hose.
    
6.  Fit the [Connection](#Connectionconnections-B56B4194) to the accumulation unit and the hot channel. Tightening torque 80Nm.
    
7.  Change the [Heating hose](#HeatingHoseheatingHose-E75FEB82).
    
8.  Apply anti-seize on the marked areas in the illustration below.
    
    **Note:** Make sure that there is no anti-seize on the conical surfaces of the heating hose nipples or the conical surfaces inside the [Connection](#Connectionconnections-B56B4194).
    
    **Note:** Anti-seize on the conical surfaces can result in twisting the heating hose during tightening, and reduce its lifetime.
    
9.  Assemble the [Heating hose](#HeatingHoseheatingHose-E75FEB82). Tightening torque 45Nm.

Equipment Status

Program Step step zero

Special Equipment

Calibrated micrometre 0 mm to 1.00 mm  
Opening force tester, TP No. 2768297-0100

Checking the lid thickness and opening force gives a good indication of the condition of the lid forming unit (**LFU**).

If the opening values are within limits according to specified values in the **OM-PC**, no further setting is necessary.

The lid thickness gives a good picture of the condition of the tools knife edge.

*   Thick, tight lids with a low opening force indicate good condition.
    
*   Thin lids with a high opening force indicate bad condition or settings. See [LFU - Troubleshooting](#section724).
    

#### Opening Force

1.  Pick eight consecutive packages from each side.
    
2.  Perform an opening test with the opening tester. Follow the instructions in the OM-PC.
    
    To identify from which mandrel/tool the lids come from, look for the mark inside the lids. For more information about tool identification, see the OM-PC.
    
3.  Note the tool number on the lid.
    

#### Lid Thickness

1.  Use the same packages used for the opening force test.
    
2.  Measure the lid thickness according to instructions in the OM-PC.
    
3.  If problems occur, check the lid thickness on the membrane and on the top, as near the top sleeve overlap as possible. Check on the LS side and on the opposite side.
    

#### Check Neck Thickness

**Valid for:** A38 Cap

1.  To be able to perform a neck thickness test, the following equipment is needed:
    
    *   a thickness gauge

### Duct and Sprue Box

When the lid is manufactured with inlet moulding, there is a leftover called [Sprue](#Spruesprue-EC927CEB). The [Sprue](#Spruesprue-EC927CEB) is separated from the lid with the [Knife](#Knifeknife-EC929524).

The [Sprue](#Spruesprue-EC927CEB) falls through the [Duct](#Ductduct-EC92993B), down to the [Sprue box](#SprueBoxsprueBox-EC928501). The [Sprue box](#SprueBoxsprueBox-EC928501) can be reached by opening the [Hatch](#Hatchhatch-EC929D72).

The [Hatch](#Hatchhatch-EC929D72) can be opened during PRODUCTION in order to empty the [Sprue box](#SprueBoxsprueBox-EC928501). The [Sprue box](#SprueBoxsprueBox-EC928501) needs to be emptied every third production hour.

When 11 000 packages have been produced according to the count on the **TPOP**, a blue alarm occurs. Empty the [Sprue box](#SprueBoxsprueBox-EC928501) and reset the blue alarm. If this is not done a yellow alarm will occur on the **TPOP** when the photocell for the [Sprue box](#SprueBoxsprueBox-EC928501) is activated. When the blue alarm has been active for 3 seconds the machine will step down to tankfilling on the affected machine side.

### Transfer Unit

The packages are transferred into the [Magazine](#Magazinemagazine-EC9362B7), by the **LFU** -stripper. The packages will then be rotated one revolution in the [Magazine](#Magazinemagazine-EC9362B7). This is done to cool down the lid before fitting the screw cap.

After one revolution the [CAU stripper](#CAUStripperCAUStripper-EC9371A2) will move the packages into the [Capping station](#CappingStationcappingStation-EC9378FB). The [CAU stripper](#CAUStripperCAUStripper-EC9371A2) is driven by the [Drive unit](#DriveUnitdriveUnit-EC936C38).

If there are packages in the capping station in this moment, they will be moved to the [Cassette](#Cassettecassettes-EC937DB9) in the package section by the **CAU** stripper in the same stroke.

**Note:** It is possible to open the upper forming pipes in the [Capping station](#CappingStationcappingStation-EC9378FB), to remove packages. See further instruction in the Operator Manual.

### Screw Cap Applicator Unit

The screw cap is assembled when the package is positioned in the [Capping station](#CappingStationcappingStation-EC9829C3). It is the [Screw Cap applicator unit](#ScrewCapApplicatorUnitsScrewCapAppl-EC98340B) that applies the screw cap to the package.

While the [CAU stripper](#CAUStripperCAUStripper-EC9820AC) moves packages and places new packages in the [Capping station](#CappingStationcappingStation-EC9829C3), the [Screw Cap applicator unit](#ScrewCapApplicatorUnitsScrewCapAppl-EC98340B) moves down and away (forward) from the [Capping station](#CappingStationcappingStation-EC9829C3) to pick up new screw caps from the screw cap handling unit (the screw cap handling unit will be described later).

Then the [Screw Cap applicator unit](#ScrewCapApplicatorUnitsScrewCapAppl-EC98340B) moves up and toward (backward) the capping station, to position the screw caps in front of the packages in the [Capping station](#CappingStationcappingStation-EC9829C3). Finally the [Screw Cap applicator unit](#ScrewCapApplicatorUnitsScrewCapAppl-EC98340B) starts to rotate the screw caps and the **CAU** stripper moves the packages toward the screw cap to assemble them. When the screw caps have been assembled, the cycle start over again.

### Screw Cap Handling

The screw caps are blown up from the **CSU** to the [Cyclone](#Cyclonecyclone-EC986A33). From the [Cyclone](#Cyclonecyclone-EC986A33), the screw caps fall down into the [Screw cap sorter](#ScrewCapSorterscrewCapSorter-EC9872A8). The [Screw cap sorter](#ScrewCapSorterscrewCapSorter-EC9872A8) turns all screw caps with the same side down to align them, then the [Screw cap sorter](#ScrewCapSorterscrewCapSorter-EC9872A8) distributes the screw caps down the [Chute](#Chutechute-EC987B73).

The screw caps are transported down the [Chute](#Chutechute-EC987B73). Further down the chute they are divided between two chutes to supply both sides of the [Screw cap transfer](#ScrewCapTransferscrewCapTransfer-EC9880DF).

The [Loading piston](#LoadingPistonloadingPiston-1D7DB3C6) transfers the screw cap through the [Tube](#Tubetube-2CB744FF) into the [Screw Cap Holder](#ScrewCapHolderscrewCapHolder-2CB748D3) in the screw cap applicator unit. The [Screw Cap Holder](#ScrewCapHolderscrewCapHolder-2CB748D3) rotates the [Screw cap](#ScrewCapscrewCap-1D7DBFC5) to match the heels in the screw cap with the heels on the loading piston and registers the screw cap position. The loading piston moves back and the screw cap applicator unit lifts the screw cap and assembles it to the package as described earlier.

### CSU

The [CSU](#CSUCSU-EC9AF1B0) feeds one TT/3 with screw caps. There are two sides in the **CSU**, **S1** and **S2** (see illustration). Each side contains a [Container](#Containercontainer-EC9AF677), and a [Fan](#FeedUnitfeedUnit-EC9AFCD5). One side of the **CSU** serves one production side on the **CAU** with screw caps.

The [Electrical cabinet](#ElectricalCabinetelectricalCabinet-EC9B07AB) serves both sides of the [CSU](#CSUCSU-EC9AF1B0).

One [Container](#Containercontainer-EC9AF677) has the capacity to hold 15 000 screw caps. A full [Container](#Containercontainer-EC9AF677) can be emptied in two minutes, using the emptying function.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000205594.png)

*   CSU
*   Container

*   Fan
*   Electrical cabinet

The screw caps are stored in the [Container](#Containercontainer-EC9B1900). From the [Container](#Containercontainer-EC9B1900) they fall down on the [Conveyer](#Conveyerconveyer-EC9B2660). The [Vibrator](#Vibratorvibrator-EC9B2C56) shakes the container to keep the screw caps from becoming jammed at the bottom of the [Container](#Containercontainer-EC9B1900).

The [Conveyer](#Conveyerconveyer-EC9B2660) transports the screw caps until they fall down into the **HEPA** -filtered air stream that is driven by the [Fan](#Fanfan-EC9B345C). Then the screw caps are blown through the [Outlet](#Outletoutlet-EC9B2FE8), and through the pipe that leads to the screw cap sorter on top of the screw cap applicator unit in the TT/3.

To perform certain maintenance procedures or to change screw cap colour, it is necessary to empty the **CSU** from screw caps. An emptying function is built in for this purpose. The [Hatch](#Hatchhatch-EC9B4761) must be folded out according to the illustration. When the [Push button](#PushButtonpushButton-EC9B4A81) is pushed, the [Conveyer](#Conveyerconveyer-EC9B2660) will reverse. Then the screw caps will be transported out through the [Hatch](#Hatchhatch-EC9B4761). For further instructions about the emptying procedure, see the Operation Manual (**OM**).

When the level of screw caps is low in the **CSU**, a blue alarm occurs. When the **CAU** is emptied, the blue alarm will remain.

### Vision Unit

The vision unit ejects packages when the screw cap is not properly attached. It is a pneumatic cylinder that ejects packages.

There is also a cylinder for volume change with two different positions depending on package height. The camera takes care of the fine adjustment automatically. For example, BASE 750 and BASE 1000 uses the same position of the volume change cylinder which the camera can handle, while for example BASE 500 and BASE 1000 use different positions for the volume change cylinder.

### 110307811/110307812, Magazine S1/S2, Servo Fault

**Description**

The [Motor](#MotorMotor-C0A8833D) rotates the [Magazine](#Magazinemagazine-C0A88B7D). If this alarm is set, it indicates that something is wrong with the position or movement of the [Magazine](#Magazinemagazine-C0A88B7D).

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000205608.png)

*   Motor
*   Magazine

**Conditions to set the alarm**

This alarm is a summary alarm and can be caused by a numerous of reasons, mechanically and electronically. The electronically reasons are the same for every servo axis in the machine. The alarms that are likely to be mechanically connected are the following.

*   `Position error fault`
    
*   `Motor overtemp fault`
    

`Position error fault` is set due to that something suddenly is disturbing the motion of the mechanics. This could be some kind of obstacle (a loose bolt etc), lack of lubrication, a stuck ball bearing.

`Motor overtemp fault` is similar to the above fault but here the disturbance is not that sudden. If the motor for some reason is forced to work harder it will become hot and the `Motor overtemp fault` will occur. The cause could be slowly degrading lubrication, wear of bearings and guides, or basically that the environment (i.e. cooling capacity) around the motor has changed.

**Troubleshooting**

*   Look for any obvious obstacles in the magazines movement. Try to rotate the mechanics manually to check that it moves smoothly.
    
*   Check that the motor, the gearbox and the rest of the mechanics are properly fixed (loose bolts etc).
    
*   Check that the electrical connections are properly connected, both to the motor and to the servo drive in the electrical cabinet. Also inspect the cables to make sure that they are not damaged.
    
*   If the magazines home position is out of place, set according to:
    
    [Magazine - Set Home Position](#section1029).

*   Motor
*   Linear unit
*   CAU stripper

**Conditions to set the alarm**

This alarm is a summary alarm and can be caused by a numerous of reasons, mechanically and electronically. The electronically reasons are the same for every servo axis in the machine. The alarms that are likely to be mechanically connected are the following.

*   `Position error fault`
    
*   `Motor overtemp fault`
    

`Position error fault` is set due to that something suddenly is disturbing the motion of the mechanics. This could be some kind of obstacle (a loose bolt etc), lack of lubrication, a stuck ball bearing.

`Motor overtemp fault` is similar to the above fault but here the disturbance is not that sudden. If the motor for some reason is forced to work harder it will become hot and the `Motor overtemp fault` will occur. The cause could be wear of bearings and guides, or basically that the environment (i.e. cooling capacity) around the motor has changed.

**Troubleshooting**

*   Look for any obvious obstacles in the **CAU** stripper. Try to move the mechanics manually to check that it moves smoothly.
    
*   Check that the motor, the gearbox and the rest of the mechanics are properly fixed (loose bolts etc).
    
*   Set the parallelism of the **CAU** stripper according to:
    
    [CAU Stripper - Set](#section1044).
    
*   Check the setting of the drive unit according to:

**Description**

When the loading piston inserts the screw cap into the screw cap holder, the control system (**PLC**) orients the screw cap by rotating it. The heels in the screw cap then grip together with the notches on the loading piston. The PLC monitors how many degrees the screw cap is rotated and how long it takes to find the heels in the screw cap.

**Conditions to set the alarm**

If the machine fails to orient three screw caps within 30 seconds, a yellow alarm will occur on the **TPOP** and the machine will step down the affected machine side.

**Troubleshooting**

*   Check that a cap is present in the cap holder to be applied to the neck. Missing cap can not be detected by the machine so the alarm will be Cap Orientation failed. see [Troubleshoot - Cap Torque Error and Tilted Caps](#section992).
    
*   Check that the screw caps have heels.
    
*   Check the function of the loading pistons.

### Troubleshoot - Cap Torque Error and Tilted Caps

2000

Equipment Status

Program Step production

#### Introduction

In the case of sporadic machine issues spread out over time, package waste figures for cap torque and tilted cap can be high even though the machine is not stopped for a specific alarm.

The reason being that the software is configured to only stop the machine if the same failure mode happens several times in a row or during a short period of time.

This trouble shooting guide is for that reason using the waste as origin instead of an alarm from TPOP.

### Troubleshoot - Quick Guide

### Troubleshoot - Cap Torque Error Waste

**Cap Torque Error, High Waste**

To guarantee that the cap is properly attached to the neck, the capping sequence has a quality control.

The cap is applied with a set torque and how many degrees the cap turns is measured.

If the cap turns more than allowed it indicates an incorrect capping, the package will then not be filled and wasted in front of the machine.

The torque error can come from that a cap is not in place to be capped, so analysing the waste is the first step in finding the root cause of the problem.

### CSU Air Speed - Check

According to the Maintenance Manual, the airspeed must not exceed 10 m/s. However, the best solution is for the airspeed to be as slow as possible. See Procedure [Feed Unit - Set Fan Speed](#section1144) .

1.  If you do not have an airspeed measuring device, slow down the fan 1 Hz at a time. Run the machine for 10 to 15 minutes.
    
2.  Repeat this step until the **CSU** fails to supply the machine with caps. Then empty the system of caps, increase the speed by 2 Hz, and then restart production. This is the best **CSU** airspeed for this equipment.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0005252825.png)

### HC Output and Temperature Sensors - Check

Sometimes capping problems occur because of heating problems or deformed necks.

1.  On the **TPOP**, check the power output to the heating elements in the **HC**. If there is a difference between 1:1 and 1:2, check the position of the temperature sensors.
    
    **Note:** It can happen that the temperature sensors slide out of position, so the power goes up when the equipment tries to keep the correct temperature.
    
    Power output should be approximately 50%.
    

### Lower Forming Tube/Plate - Check

Equipment Status

Air must be turn OFF.  
Program Step

1.  Check that the [Plate](#Plateplate-24EDAE92) is correctly mounted and is in contact against the **CAU** frame. If the [Plate](#Plateplate-24EDAE92) is not mounted correctly, it causes high cap waste.

### C38 Kit - Check

1.  Check the latest **SPC** (SPC-3592746-XXXX) that you have all the correct C38 kit parts.
    

### How to Understand Cap-Related Waste

There are two types of cap-related waste:

*   camera waste
    
*   **FM** waste
    

For camera waste, it is important to differentiate ghost waste from tilted caps:

*   Ghost waste occurs due to a faulty camera setting.
    
*   Tilted caps occur due to heat problems in the top, or misalignment in the **CAU**.
    

For **FM** waste, see Section [How to Understand Cap Waste in FM](#section1011).

### How to Understand Cap Waste in FM

Broken caps on the sprue box cause wasted packages without caps. Broken caps are caps that have been smashed in the cap loading area. The caps are smashed because they have been in the wrong position (not all the way down or fallen) during the cap loading sequence.

Reasons for broken caps:

*   The 69-mm setting of the cap loading position is not set correctly. See Procedure [Cap Loading Piston, Template, Setting - Check](#section1002).
    

*   The ends of the cap chutes are bent. See Procedure [Cap Chute Quality - Check](#section1005).
    

*   The cap hatches or cap chutes are not set correctly causing lack of cue pressure, which makes the caps fall in the cap loading position. See Procedure [Cap Chute Hatch Setting - Check](#section1004).
    

*   The Y-setting is wrong causing lack of caps and cue pressure. See Procedure [Direction Guide, Air Nozzle - Check](#section1000).
    

*   Wrong type of cap chute lids. See Procedure [Cap Chute Lids - Check](#section999).
    

*   The springs are broken.
    

*   Wrong type of bushings. See Procedure [Bushing - Check](#section1001).
    

### FAQ

*   Why are there many plastic particles everywhere?
    
    1.  The **CSU** speed is set too high. See Procedure [CSU Air Speed - Check](#section997).
        
    2.  Make sure you have the correct air flow. See Procedure [CSU Air Speed - Check](#section997).
        

*   Why do the caps get stuck in the cap trap in the sorter?

Risk of crushing.

Be careful when activating the cylinder.

The air cylinder moves if it is activated by compressed air.

This operation is done to ensure a correct overloading of the loading pistons. Too little overloading makes the screw caps fall out of the screw cap holders, too much overloading breaks the capping cylinder.

3.  Before performing this setting, make sure that the cap lift is in cap transfer position. See Procedure [Screw Cap Lift - Set End Positions](#section1112).
    
4.  Activate the capping cylinder valves to push the screw cap holders in loading position. To activate the valves, see Procedure [Pneumatic Valves - Manual Override](#section2114).

6.  Rotate the screw cap holders to the left, gently by hand, until the heels in the screw caps are aligned with the notches on the [Loading piston](#LoadingPistonloadingPistons-219D12E2).
    
    **Note:** This step is performed to ensure that the over travel distance will be correct. If the notches on the loading piston and the heels in the screw caps are interfering in the wrong way, the over travel distance will be incorrect.
    
7.  Use a feelergauge to check the distance **A** between the [Loading piston](#LoadingPistonloadingPistons-219D12E2) and the [Bracket](#Bracketbracket-219CA935).
    
8.  To set the distance **A**, loosen the [Lock nut](#Locknutlocknut-219D54EE) and adjust the position of the [Bracket](#Bracketbracket-219CA935) with the [Adjustment screw](#AdjustmentScrewadjustmentScrew-219D5FAC) and tighten the [Lock nut](#Locknutlocknut-219D54EE).

### Functional Description

**Introduction**

The unfinished packages enter the package section from the mandrel wheels and are placed in cassettes. These cassettes transport the package through the filling and bottom sealing mechanisms. The packages are then placed on an outfeed unit and exit the machine.

**Note:** Read the description in the specific sections for more information.

**Conveyor and Conveyor Drive Unit**

The conveyor is made up by a number off cassettes, the unit that drives them and various equipment that guides the cassettes.

The cassette conveyor is driven by two servo motors attached to two planetary gearboxes. The front and back wheels are driven by separate servomotors. The front wheel is automatically adjusted by a homing procedure. The mechanical play is by default set to 70% between the upper cassettes and 30% between the lower cassettes. The mechanical play of the front wheel can be adjusted on the TPOP. The start position of the rear wheel (the infeed wheel) is adjusted on the TPOP. The drive unit is also synchronized with the other movements in the machine through the PLC system.

**Bottom Sealing**

The Bottom sealer has two servo driven units. The first of these is the lifting unit that lifts the cassette with the filled package, the cassette stabilizer and the volume displacement cylinders. The second unit is the sealing unit with a knee mechanism that moves the sonotrodes and the dolly and assures the sealing by a pneumatic spring force.

**Final Folder**

The function of the final folder unit is to fold the transversal seal, form it to flaps and seal them to the bottom of the package to make the package stand steadily.

**Outfeed Unit**

The function of the discharger unit is to pull the packages from the cassettes and place them on the conveyor chain. Packages with unsealed flaps are detected by a photocell (in the machine body) and ejected.

**Hygiene Chamber**

The hygiene chamber prevents contamination from the surrounding environment. This is done in three steps:

*   Spray of H2O2 peroxide solution.
    
*   High energy UV-radiation.
    
*   Removing peroxide residue using hot HEPA-filtrated air.

### 110304351 / 110304352, Packages Infeed into Cassette Failed

**Description**

When the sleeve enters the cassette, the cassette centring secures the cassette in a position aligned with the sleeve. This ensures that the sleeve moves all the way into cassette.

There is a fibre optic sensor, mounted on the infeed hatches, which has one sender and one receiver. This sensor detects if the package fail to go all the way into the cassette.

**Condition for Alarm**

The package is not properly placed in the cassette.

**Troubleshooting**

*   Check that the centering of the cassette stabilisers works smoothly and is correctly set. See Section [5.6.4.1-1 Cassette Centring](#section1402).
    
*   Check the lugs for wear and that the cylinder is not leaking air. Change if necessary. See Procedure [5.6.4.1-4 Cassette Centring – Overhaul](#section1406).
    
*   If the machine is equipped with a **CAU**, check the alignment between the capping station and the cassette. See Procedure [4.4.5-3 Capping Station - Set to Package Section](#section1049).

### 110312481 / 110312482, Gas Dosing, Wrong Pressure

**Description**

Some products will be affected by oxygen in the head-space of the package. Vitamins, colour and taste can be affected. If the oxygen level is reduced, from the normal 21% to about 8-10%, the shelf life of the product can be increased considerably. The gas dosing system does that by replacing the oxygen in the head-space with substitute gas.

Gas at 4-6bar passes from the supply unit, through a connection at the filling platform, to a valve block in the front of the machine. The valves switch between gas dosing and compressed air. A proportional valve reduces the gas pressure to the value that is set in the **PLC**. This is about 2.5bar during production.

The valves will be switching on and off during production.

**Condition for Alarm**

The gas dosing pressure is outside the **PLC** limits.

**Troubleshooting**

*   Check the manometers in the front of the machine.
    
*   Check that the valves switch fast enough between on and off.
    
*   Check that the gas dosing valves work properly.
    

### 110304050, Air Supply and Pressure to the Safety Valve

**Troubleshooting**

*   Make sure that the air pressure is set correctly on the main ramp. See Procedure 6.6.1-1 Pneumatic Supply - Set Pressure (Festo, Mecman), in the MM.
    
*   Make sure that the manual valve before the safety valve is open. See Procedure Safety Air Valve - Description.
    
*   Make sure that the manometer on the safety air valve shows at least 6bar. If it shows < 3bar, there is an air leakage problem, and the safety air valve will not fully pressurise the system. Check for air leakage.
    
*   If the safety air valve shows 6 bar, there should be a signal from the pressure guard. Check the electrical connection to the pressure guard and the Point I/O input. The pressure guard is factory set and should normally not be adjusted.

### Functional Description

1.  [Lifting unit](#LiftingUnitLiftingUnit-CF466384) that lifts the cassette, the filled package, the cassette stabilizer and the volume displacement cylinders. This unit is driven by a [Servomotor](#Servomotorservomotor-CF467580) and a [Belt drive](#BeltDrivebeltDrive-CF468690).
    
2.  [Sealing unit](#SealingUnitSealingUnit-CF466E18) with a knee mechanism that moves the [US-horn](#US-hornUS-horn-CF468FC7) and the [Anvil](#Anvilanvil-CF46979D) and assures the sealing by a pneumatic spring force. This unit is driven by a [Servomotor](#Servomotorservomotor-CF469ECA) and a [Ball screw](#BallScrewballScrew-CF46A514).

*   Ball screw

### Knee Mechanism of the Sealing Unit

The [Ball screw](#BallScrewballScrew-CF487A0A) is driving a linear guided [Yoke](#Yokeyoke-CF4991B7) in vertical direction. To make the linear jaw movement between the anvil and the US-horns, the yoke is linked with [Link arm](#LinkArmlinkArms-CF499CE5) to:

*   a horizontal linear unit to drive the [Anvil](#Anvilanvil-CF49CBAD)
    
*   one linear unit with [Pneumatic spring carriage](#PneumaticSpringCarriagepneumaticSpr-CF49DF00) and [Pneumatic spring carriage](#PneumaticSpringCarriagepneumaticSpr-CF49E4C6),
    
*   one [Overtravel carriage](#OvertravelCarriageovertravelCarriag-CF49F6B3) to drive the **US**\-horns.
    

The knee mechanism unit is fixed to the frame with [Linear bearing](#LinearBearinglinearBearings-CF4A087D) and [Linear bearing](#LinearBearinglinearBearings-CF4A10D3).

The movements are shown in the illustration below.

### Folding

During the dwell time of the cassette conveyer, the folding and sealing take place. A synchronized movement of the lifter and knee mechanism makes the folding. This combined movement follows a predicted [Folding curve](#FoldingCurvefoldingCurve-CF4A69A5).

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000155803.png)

### Sealing Functionality

The [US-horn](#US-hornUS-horns-CFAC0BBB) are clamped with a [Mechanical joint](#MechanicalJointmechanicalJoint-CFAC4369) to [Pneumatic spring carriage](#PneumaticSpringCarriagepneumaticSpr-CFAC1707) and [Pneumatic spring carriage](#PneumaticSpringCarriagepneumaticSpr-CFAC1AC9) which can move independently from each other. On these pneumatic spring carriages there are four [Pneumatic membrane](#PneumaticMembranepneumaticMembranes-CFAC2065) that are always pressurized with the setting from a [Regulator](#Regulatorregulator-CFAC738D). The membranes are pressing against the [Overtravel carriage](#OvertravelCarriageovertravelCarriag-CFAC24A1).

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000155831.png)

*   US-horn
*   Mechanical joint

*   Pneumatic spring carriage
*   Pneumatic spring carriage

*   Pneumatic membrane
*   Regulator

*   Overtravel carriage

The three carriages move together as a group. When the knee mechanism is moving down, the force is almost infinite when the [Link](#Linklink-CFAC7C93) reaches its nearly straight position. At this point the mechanism reaches an end point due to that the distance between the anvil and **US**\-horns is zero. This is basic setting for the end point of the servomotor.

When the folded package is squeezed between the [Anvil](#Anvilanvil-CFAC823B) and the [US-horn](#US-hornUS-horns-CFAC0BBB) there will be a distance D of 0.4 mm compressed paperboard. The [Overtravel carriage](#OvertravelCarriageovertravelCarriag-CFAC24A1) moves then into the [Pneumatic membrane](#PneumaticMembranepneumaticMembranes-CFAC2065) leaving a distance E of 0.35 mm in-between the [Pneumatic spring carriage](#PneumaticSpringCarriagepneumaticSpr-CFAC1707) and [Pneumatic spring carriage](#PneumaticSpringCarriagepneumaticSpr-CFAC1AC9) and the [Overtravel carriage](#OvertravelCarriageovertravelCarriag-CFAC24A1). The force in the system is now set to the pneumatic pressure in the membranes and the sealing pulse can be performed.

### Sealing Pressure Regulators - Set

Equipment Status

Air must be turn ON.  

1.  To decrease sealing pressure, turn the hand wheel counter-clockwise.
    
    **Note:** When decreasing pressure, it is necessary to turn approximately 0.4 bar below the estimated value, and then up again to the value.
    
2.  To increase sealing pressure, turn the hand wheel clockwise.
    
3.  Basic setting: choose the same pressure reading for both [Pressure regulators](#PressureRegulatorspressureRegulator-99E671AF) one pressure regulator for each subside of the machine).
    
4.  At production, fine tune each side after checking the sealing quality.
    
    **Note:** During manufacturing and assembling of converters and sonotrodes, there is always a difference in the amplitude movement of the unit. This means that the air pressure regulators for the sealing pressure may have to be set individually between the subunit to create the same energy so that a good sealing can be produced. The energy values can be shown on the TPOP monitoring window.

### UV-lamp

Safety hazard.

Read and follow the safety precautions carefully before starting any work on the UV-lamp.

There are several safety hazards involved when working with the UV-lamp.

### Functional Description

The **UV**\-lamp system consists of two **UV**\-lamp units and their cooling system (one on each side of machine side).

The combination of peroxide and **UV**\-radiation effectively disinfects the surface of the packaging material.

In order to reduce heat, the **UV**\-lamp is cooled by a [Venting fan](#VentingFanventingFan-D34A58C5), which sucks air through the [Lamp housing](#LampHousinglampHousing-D34A5D84).

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002747703.png)

*   Venting fan

*   Temperature sensor

*   Lamp housing

The cooling capacity (speed of venting fan) is controlled by the [Temperature sensor](#TemperatureSensortemperatureSensor-D34A24B3) and a frequency converter. The optimal cooling air temperature is 55 °C. (The cooling temperature is permanently preset. It is not necessary to check or adjust it.)

**Illumination of the hygiene chamber by UV light:**

The **UV** light has an additional function [Illumination by UV light](#IlluminationByUVLightilluminationBy-D34C8C83), which can be used to illuminate the hygiene chamber for approximately 10 minutes. The **UV** lamp will be extinguished (goes immediately out) under alarm conditions or upon opening of a door.

To prevent overheating of the package cassettes, the lamp will only work during the program steps MOTOR RUNNING, PRODUCTION, END PRODUCTION, and when the machine is performing a VOLUME CHANGE.

Drive Unit
----------

### Functional Description

The Cassette Conveyor is driven by a [Servomotor](#Servomotorservomotor-D55A9E8B), through a [Planetary gear](#PlanetaryGearplanetaryGear-D55AA85E) (gear ratio 80:1) and two bevel gear boxes ([Bevel gearbox VV1](#BevelGearboxVV1bevelGearboxVV1-D55ACEC1) and [Bevel gearbox VV2](#BevelGearboxVV2bevelGearboxVV2-D55AD4DD) (gear ratio 2:1)). It is synchronised with the other movements in the machine through the **PLC** system.

The system cannot be cranked by hand. It must be driven using the inch button on the panel.

Oil level sensors are built in to the bevel gearboxes VV1 and VV2. If an oil level is low, an alarm on the panel signals. The alarm only signals if the machine has been out of operation for more than one hour. During operation, the oil is tossed around in the gears, which could result in false alarms. The planetary gear (2) is filled with grease.

All four drive shafts are equipped with a [Safety clutch](#SafetyClutchsafetyClutch-D55ADB7F) that releases at 250Nm. A [Proximity switch](#ProximitySwitchproximitySwitch-D55AE04D) senses when the clutch releases and stops the machine.

12.  If the Mecman sensor is used, make sure that the [End limit sensor](#EndLimitSensorendLimitSensor-D5FA55D4) is positioned as far down as possible. This is so that the [End limit sensor](#EndLimitSensorendLimitSensor-D5FA55D4) can be used in homing the actuator.
    
    If the Sick sensor is used, make sure that the tip of the [End limit sensor](#EndLimitSensorendLimitSensor-D5FA55D4) is positioned 4.6 mm above the bottom surface on the linear actuator. This is so that the [End limit sensor](#EndLimitSensorendLimitSensor-D5FA55D4) can be used in homing the actuator.
    
13.  Risk of damage to the volume plate.
    
    The guide studs have to be turned outwards, otherwise they would crash against the volume plate.
    
    Set the distance between the [Upper guide stud](#UpperGuideStudupperGuideStuds-D5FA60A7) and [Lower guide stud](#LowerGuideStudlowerGuideStuds-D5FA6645), by inserting a volume plate between them, and turning the [Lower guide stud](#LowerGuideStudlowerGuideStuds-D5FA6645). The volume plate has to move stiffly between the studs, which means that the distance between the studs must be 0.1 - 0.2mm smaller than the volume plate.
    
14.  Put the eight cassettes back.
    
15.  Reset the cassette wheel.
    
16.  Tighten the clamp screws to 130Nm.
    
17.  To define zero-position for the device, move it up a bit, step the machine to program step Air On and then flip the service key to on and off again.

Conveyor, Cassette Lubrication
------------------------------

### Functional Description

The Cassette Lubrication is intended both for rinsing after a crash and for lubrication during production. During rinsing after a crash, minor product residues on the cassettes are flushed off. During production, the cassette links are lubricated with water.

Drinking water, with no chemicals added is used, and a [UV-lamp](#UV-lampForSterilizingLubricationWat-D6DE1112) is sterilizing the water beforehand, for both machine sides. The system is automatically rinsed with Oxonia through the [Valve](#Valvevalve-D6DE2351) during each disinfection phase.

*   Flushing to remove product residue after a stop is done by the [Spraying nozzle](#SprayingNozzlesprayingNozzles-D6DE431D). This function must be started on the **TPOP**. The [Pressure reducing valve](#PressureReducingValvepressureReduci-D6DE4AE0) must be set according to [Lubrication Water - Check](#section1525).
    
    **Note:** The cassettes must be empty before flushing is possible.

Gas Dosing System (Optional Equipment)
--------------------------------------

### Functional Description

**Valid for Festo and Mecman**

Not all machines have the gas dosing system.

Some products are affected by oxygen in the head-space of the package. Vitamins, colour, and taste can be affected. If the oxygen level is reduced, from the normal 21% to about 8 to 10%, the shelf life of the product can be increased considerably. The gas dosing system does that by replacing the oxygen with a substitute gas.

*   Gas at 4 to 6bar passes from the supply unit through a connection at the filling platform to a [Valve block](#ValveBlockvalveBlock-18662D8D) in the front of the machine. The valves switch between substitute gas and compressed air.
    
*   A [Proportional valve](#ProportionalValveproportionalValve-18664815) reduces the gas dosing pressure to the value that is set in the **PLC**\-program. This is about 2.5bar during production.
    

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0001630908.png)

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0001630907.png)

*   Valve block
*   Proportional valve

*   The gas enters a filter unit that consists of a [5 micron filter](#MicronFilter5MicronFilter-4FE44E06) and a [0.01 micron filter](#MicronFilter0.01MicronFilter-4FE44E06).
    
*   The gas is then distributed to the two stations through [Fixed restriction](#FixedRestrictionfixedRestrictions-4FE44E04) and 0.2micron [Absolute filter](#AbsoluteFilterabsoluteFilters-4FE44E04) that filter the gas once again.
    

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000156320.png)

*   5 micron filter
*   0.01 micron filter
*   Fixed restriction
*   Absolute filter

Two stations are fitted over the packages as follows:

[Station 1](#Station1Station1-4FE3FE75)

Located before the product filling.

[Station 2](#Station2Station2-4FE3FE75)

Located between the filling pipes and the bottom sealing.

*   When the gas dosing system is functioning but not in production there is a constant flow of compressed air through it. The airflow stops bacteria from entering the gas dosing system when the gas is turned off. This also reduces the gas consumption.
    
*   As soon as a sleeve is fed from the cutting device into the conveyor (at production start), the valves switch from air to gas with a pulsed flow through the [Pulse valve](#PulseValvepulseValves-4FE3FE75).

When the **TTCU** starts to clean the hygiene chamber the [Valve](#Valvevalve-12213-4FE40436), [Valve](#Valvevalve-12214-4FE40436) and [Drain Valve](#DrainValvedrainValve-4FE40436) close and the [Cleaning Solution Valve](#CleaningSolutionValvecleaningSoluti-4FE40436) and the [Valve](#Valvevalve-4FE40436) opens. The [Valve](#Valvevalve-12213-4FE40436) and [Valve](#Valvevalve-12214-4FE40436) create a buffer that ensures that no build up of liquid reaches the [Absolute filter](#AbsoluteFilterabsoluteFilters-4FE44E04). The valves stay in this configuration for all the **TTCU** cycles until the disinfection starts. In the disinfection cycle, the [Valve](#Valvevalve-12213-4FE40436) opens and the area between the [Valve](#Valvevalve-12213-4FE40436) and [Valve](#Valvevalve-12214-4FE40436) is disinfected. After the hygiene chamber clean is complete the [Cleaning Solution Valve](#CleaningSolutionValvecleaningSoluti-4FE40436) closes and the [Drain Valve](#DrainValvedrainValve-4FE40436) opens to drain the remaining liquid and remains open during production. At this time the [Valve](#Valvevalve-12213-4FE40436) and [Valve](#Valvevalve-12214-4FE40436) opens and the [Pulse valve](#PulseValvepulseValves-4FE3FE75) starts to pulsate. Compressed air is then pushed through the system to push out any remaining fluids.

### Functional Description

**Introduction**

The filling section has two main tasks:

*   to provide the right amount of filling product to the packages in the hygiene chamber.
    
*   to perform and support hygiene functions of the filling machine (with the exception of external cleaning in the hygiene chamber cleaning and package disinfection).
    

The filling section is also the main supply distributor for granulate, drinking water, ice water, air, and gas (gas is only valid if the machine is equipped with the gas dosing system).

For a functional description of the filling system, see page [Filling System](#section1547).

For a functional description of the hygiene functions, see page [Hygiene Functions](#section1548).

### Filling System

**Note:** Distance filling is used on a ADY variant machine. Bottom up filling is used on a standard variant machine.

**Note:** It is only possible to produce sweetened condensed milk on both production sides at the same time.

The two production sides of the machine can produce two different products at the same time. Two separate 50 litre tanks for the filling product(s) enable the machine to fill two different products simultaneously and independently.

The product enters the tank via a [Valve](#ValveValve-F771ED2C). The valve keeps the product level in the tank relatively constant. Information about the current level is communicated from the [Level probe](#LevelProbeLevelProbe-F7720145) via a signal from the [PLC](#PLCPLC-F771F9CC) to the control unit in the [Valve](#ValveValve-F771ED2C).

Two filling pipes lead the product from the tank to the packages. A servo-assisted piston pump measure and portion the filling product from the package's open bottom end. For a functional description of the piston pump see [Pump Units](#section1635).

### Hygiene Functions

The following list is a brief overview of the **TT/3** filling machine hygiene functions:

*   Cleaning of the filling system, **CIP**. See page [Cleaning of the Filling System (Cleaning In Place, CIP)](#section1549).
    
*   Sterilisation of the filling system, **SIP**. See page [Sterilisation of the Filling System (Sterilisation In Place, SIP)](#section1550).
    
*   Quick Rinse, **QR** (Optional for **XH**). See page [Quick Rinse of the Filling System (QR Optional)](#section1551).
    
*   Cleaning and disinfection of the hygiene chamber. See page [Cleaning and Disinfection of the Hygiene Chamber](#section1552).
    

The machine program is configurated to perform cleaning in place, sterilisation in place, quick rinse, cleaning, and disinfection when started by the operator from the **TPOP**.

*   Clean air system, filtered HEPA. See page [Clean Air System](#section1553).
    

*   Pre-treatment of the packaging material web, H202 (valid for **AD**, **ADY**, **SD**, **ASCM**, and Water). See Section [Peroxide Unit](#section518) on page [Peroxide Unit](#section518).
    
*   Package disinfection, UV+H2O2. See Section [Peroxide Unit](#section518) on page [Peroxide Unit](#section518).
    

For machine variant **XH**, the operator must activate, from the **TPOP**, the hydrogen peroxide system to run the machine with hydrogen peroxide.

For machine variants **AD**, **ADY**, **SD**, **ASCM**, and Water, the machine is automatically run with hydrogen peroxide.

For machines variants **XH**, **3A** and **XHIC**, a short automatic purge is performed every four hours during production.

### Cleaning of the Filling System (Cleaning In Place, CIP)

The **CIP** cleans the filling system by using the diary cleaning supplies systems or by using a separate unit called **ALCIP**.

The purpose of the **CIP** is to ensure that there are no residual product in the filling system nor in their connections. The program is performed in many steps. See the flow charts and sequence diagram for more information on the **CIP** steps. The flow charts and the sequence diagram are laminated documents. The sequence diagrams can also be seen in Chapter [General](#section2093). For more information see also the **OM**.

### Sterilisation of the Filling System (Sterilisation In Place, SIP)

The purpose of the **SIP** is to reduce the number of bacteria in the filling system. This is done by the **SIP** and must be preceded by a complete **CIP**.

*   Steam sterilisation 122°C, 20 minutes
    
*   Cooling
    
*   Pressure balance. The purpose of the last step is to balance the pressure and cool the pipes in order to make production start possible.
    

See the flow charts and sequence diagram for more information on the **SIP** steps. The flow charts and the sequence diagram are laminated documents. The sequence diagrams can also be seen in Chapter [General](#section2093). For more information see also the **OM**.

### Quick Rinse of the Filling System (QR Optional)

The purpose of the **QR** is to rinse out product left in the filling system at the time for product change.

The **QR** option differ from product to product and must be evaluated and defined. The result of a **QR** is a product contact surfaces that are visually clean. The principle of the **QR** program is to open up paths of the product contact surfaces in the filling system. 2 to 3 paths are used and repeated a number of times.

It is site responsibility to evaluate an define how many times the water rinse sequences should be repeated. The total time needed for a **QR** is the time that the water (at specified quality) must be supplied to the **TT/3** .

### Cleaning and Disinfection of the Hygiene Chamber

The purpose of the cleaning and disinfection is to remove residual product and to reduce the number of bacteria in the area where the packages are filled and sealed.

This is performed by a separate unit, the Tetra Top Cleaning Unit **(TTCU)**. For more information on the **TTCU** see Chapter [Tetra Top Cleaning Unit](#section1988). See also the **OM**.

### Clean Air System

High Efficiency Particulate Air (**HEPA**) flows from cabinets and units to the:

•

Hygiene chamber. The **HEPA** cabinet for the Package Section (**PS**) provides the hygiene chamber with a defined flow of filtered **HEPA**. Here, the purpose of HEPA is to prevent contamination from the surrounding environment during the filling and sealing processes. The filtered **HEPA** enters the hygiene chamber where the packages enter chamber and above the bottom sealing.

•

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reducer. The H2O2 reducer has outlets above the cassettes in the hygiene chamber as hot filtered HEPA is used for removing the H2O2 residue in the packages before filling.

•

Tank breathing and cleaning boxes. The filtered **HEPA** from the **HEPA** cabinet for the Filling Section (**FS**) prevents the surrounding air from entering the product tanks during filling. The excess air from the tanks is directed to the cleaning boxes where it is distributed around the filling pipes.

•

**Valid for:** Hygiene level UHH

Lid Forming Unit (**LFU**). The **HEPA** cabinet for **LFU** provides a defined flow of filtered **HEPA** over the **LFU**. Here, the purpose of HEPA is to prevent contamination from the surrounding environment. The **HEPA** filter is in the filter housing above the **LFU**.

•

**Valid for:** Hygiene level UHH

**Valid for:** Equipment with CAU

Cap Application Unit (**CAU**). The **HEPA** cabinet for **CAU** provides a defined flow of filtered HEPA over the **CAU** to prevent contamination from the surrounding environment. The **HEPA** filter is in the filter housing above the **CAU**.

### Functional Description

**Angle seat valve**

The main parts of the angle seat valve are shown in the illustration below.

The following instructions cover both **NC** (Normally Closed) and **NO** (Normally Open) valves.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000209397.png)

*   Actuator

**No Product In Hepa (NPIH) system**

It is very important that product never reaches the **HEPA** filters in the machine for any reason. If this happens the hygiene in the machine will be lost. To prevent this from happening, a system consisting of an [Air sensor](#AirSensorairSensor-F969B7B7), [Pressure gauge](#PressureGaugepressureGauge-F969C372), Product Relief Valve ([PRV](#PRVPRV-F969C5BB)), [High pipe](#HighPipehighPipe-F969C7D2) and [Non-return valve](#Non-returnValvenon-returnValve-F969C993) has been implemented on the machine.

The first part of the system works by detecting air and high pressure in the product and consists of the [Air sensor](#AirSensorairSensor-F969B7B7) and the [Pressure gauge](#PressureGaugepressureGauge-F969C372). The second part is the relief part and works by closing the [Product valve](#ProductValveproductValve-F969CBF8) and opening the [PRV](#PRVPRV-F969C5BB) when air or high pressure is detected. The system ensures that any product containing air or too high pressure is drained out without reaching the [Product tank](#ProductTankproductTank-F969CDD4).

During production, two scenarios can set a high product pressure yellow alarm.

1) The product pressure is higher than 200 kPa for more than 10 seconds.

2) The pressure peaks at above 200 kPa for more than 2 seconds 10 times.

If the alarm occurs the machine empties out all packages and steps down to program step Preheating.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000209396.png)

*   Air sensor
*   Pressure gauge
*   **PRV**
*   High pipe

*   Non-return valve
*   Product valve
*   Product tank

During **CIP** a yellow alarm occurs if the pressure is above 4 kPa for more than 2 seconds.

If the [Air sensor](#AirSensorairSensor-F96A83CA) detects air during program step production, the [PRV](#PRVPRV-F96A88DA) immediately opens and a blue alarm occurs. If air is detected for more than 10 seconds, the [Product valve](#ProductValveproductValve-F96A8F8D) closes and the air in product yellow alarm occurs.

**Note:** The pressure release function is disabled for ADY.

During the program steps Tankfilling and Motor on the air in product yellow alarm is set immediately if the [Air sensor](#AirSensorairSensor-F96A83CA) detects air.

**Note:** The pressure release function is disabled for ADY.

The **PRV** can also be opened manually in certain program steps to purge unwanted product from the machine. See the **OM** for more information.

As an added backup the HEPA air pipe into the [Product tank](#ProductTankproductTank-F96A9213) also includes a [Non-return valve](#Non-returnValvenon-returnValve-F96A8D37). This [Non-return valve](#Non-returnValvenon-returnValve-F96A8D37) stops any splash in the product tank so that it does not reach the HEPA air system. Splashing can be caused by bubbles that enter the [Product tank](#ProductTankproductTank-F96A9213). The non-return valve also stops product from reaching the HEPA air system through overfilling of the [Product tank](#ProductTankproductTank-F96A9213) if the level probe fails for any reason.

#### Initialization

During initialization the positioner adapts itself optimally to the friction conditions and the signal pressure required by the control valve.

Risk of injury due to the actuator stem extending or retracting.

Do not touch or block the actuator stem.

The process is disturbed by the movement of the actuator stem.

Do not initialize the positioner while the process is running and only after isolating the plant by closing the shut-off valves.

The type and extent of self-adaptation depends on the preset parameters. MAX applies as the default setting for the nominal range (Code **P4**). During the initialization process, the positioner determines the total travel range or rotational range of the valve (from the CLOSED position to the opposite end position).

Alternatively, a different travel can be selected in Code **P4** (see code list in [Setting other valid parameters](#SettingOtherValidParameters-01F0488A).

**Note:** The travel set in Code **P4** is only limited during initialization. However, it might be exceeded in closed-loop control when the control signal is higher than 20 mA.

Start initialization

2.  Enable configuration according to Procedure [Enabling configuration to change parameters](#EnablingConfigurationToChangeParame-01EC02B7).
    
3.  Touch [DOWN button](#DOWNButtonDOWNButton-EB517505) or [UP button](#UPButtonUPButton-EB51785C) until Code **P15** appears.

In case of a fault, the [Fault indication icon](#Fault-EC5BDA9F) is displayed. Switch past Code P0 or P20 to display the respective error code E0 to E15 together with ERR appear on the display. Refer to the [Error codes](#section1634) list on page [Error codes](#section1634) for the cause of the errors and the recommended action.

**Example:**

If, for instance, a travel has been entered in Code P4 (nominal range) which is larger than the maximum valve travel possible, the initialization process would be interrupted (E2 error code) because the rated travel would not have been reached (E6 error code). The valve moves to the [Fail-safe position active](#Fail-safePositionActive-ECDD631F).

### Functional Description

The [Fill pump](#FillPumpfillPump-FA8734D8) is driven by a [Servo motor](#Servomotorservomotor-FA8734D8). The Universal Product Valves [Inlet UPV](#InletUPVinletUPV-FA8734D8) and [UPV](#OutletUPVoutletUPV-FA8734D6), and the [Resuction device](#ResuctionDeviceresuctionDevice-FA8734D6) are pneumatically activated, and the timing is coordinated from the servo to ensure correct speed and accurate filling.

The servo motor drives the fill pump. The servo motor contains a motor combined with a roller screw. This results in a reliable high-speed filling system. Each time that the machine steps up to program step Air on, a homing procedure is performed on the servo motors. The servo motor is oil cooled and lubricated in order to keep correct working temperature.

Before production, air is purged from the system and a column of product stands ready for filling. This is activated on the **TPOP**. Both the [Inlet UPV](#InletUPVinletUPV-FA8734D8) and the [UPV](#OutletUPVoutletUPV-FA8734D6) are closed at the start of production.

*   At the end of the charge stroke, the inlet **UPV** closes.
    

The process repeats itself throughout production.

The [Leakage detector](#LeakageDetectorLeakageDetectors-8222-FA8734D6) detects any leakage behind the diaphragm in the [Fill pump](#FillPumpfillPump-FA8734D8).

#### Preparations of the Piston Pump

1.  Disassemble the piston pump, follow the sub procedure
    
    *   [Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms](#section1643) (see Procedure [Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms](#section1643)).
        
        or
        
    *   [Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms and Seals](#section1644) (see Procedure [Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms and Seals](#section1644)).
        
2.  Risk of damage to the equipment.
    
    The piston surface can easily be damaged, which can lead to premature failure of the diaphragms. Never use a vice to hold the piston unit.
    
    Remove the six [Screw](#Screwscrew-F9EE0EB1), the [Connection plate](#ConnectionPlateconnectionPlate-F9EE1061) and the [Rear diaphragm](#RearDiaphragmrearDiaphragm-F9EE12E5) from the [Piston](#Pistonpiston-F9EE14C7).
    
3.  Remove the [Nut](#Nutnut-F9EE16B3), the [Washer](#Washerwasher-F9EE1932), the [Plate](#Plateplate-F9EE1BE2), and [Front diaphragm](#FrontDiaphragmfrontDiaphragm-F9EE1DAB).
    
4.  Reassemble a [Piston unit](#PistonUnitpistonUnit-F9EE1FB9) with a [Connection plate](#ConnectionPlateconnectionPlate-F9EE1061), six [Screw](#Screwscrew-F9EE0EB1) and a [Piston](#Pistonpiston-F9EE14C7).
    
    **Note:** The procedure is valid for variant Base, Midi, and Mini. The procedure for variant Micro is similar to that procedure and therefore not described.

### Vacuum System Functional Description

The purpose of the vacuum system is to make sure that the diaphragms are always in contact with the piston pumps. This ensures that the diaphragms do not fold or break prematurely.

Compressed air enters the system through the [Connection](#Connectionconnection-FA018340) and is regulated with the [Valve](#Valvevalve-FA018974). The vacuum is continuously measured by the [Pressure guard](#PressureGuardpressureGuard-FA018F6A) and the [Valve](#Valvevalve-FA018974) opens when the vacuum is above -60 kPa (-0.6 bar) and it remains open for 10 seconds to build up the vacuum again. If the vacuum is above the allowed value for more than 30 seconds the blue alarm occurs. If the vacuum rises above -50 kPa (-0.5 bar) the yellow alarm occurs. The vacuum itself is generated in the [Ejector](#Ejectorejector-FA019407) as the compressed air passes through it and out the [Hose](#Hosehose-FA0197BE). The passing air sucks out the air in the rest of the system and creates the vacuum. The vacuum is preserved with the [Non-return valve](#Non-returnValvenon-returnValve-FA019ACC).

*   Valve
*   Pressure guard

*   Non-return valve

There is one vacuum cabinet for each side of the machine. The system is then divided at the [T-connection](#T-connectionT-connection-FA019F3D) and supplies both piston pumps for that side of the machine. The [Non-return valve](#Non-returnValvenon-returnValve-FA01A42B) and [Non-return valve](#Non-returnValvenon-returnValve-FA01A6CA) ensures that if one diaphragm leaks, the other piston pump will not be contaminated.

The vacuum system is always supplied with compressed air, even if the machine is stepped down to program step Zero.

Ice water
---------

### Functional Description

**Note:** The ice water cooling of the product tank is disconnected for the machine variant AW.

The ice water that flows through the TT/3 ice water system is supplied by the customer's external ice water system. The TT/3 must be supplied with a flow of 85l/min and the ice water must have a temperature of 1 to 7˚C (33.8 to 44.6 °F). The flow and temperature are both measured and logged by the TT/3.

The ice water circulates through the **HEPA** cabinets and the cooling mantle of the product tank before it returns to the customer's external ice water system. The **HEPA** cabinets must be continually cooled with ice water to ensure a high hygienic level. The mantle of the product tank is only filled from program step tank filling to program step production end. During these program steps, the cooling effect keeps the product in the tank cool.

When a **CIP** or **SIP** is performed on the TT/3, the ice water shall not be on in the mantle. If the ice water is on, the rapid heating during these procedures can cause problems with expanding steam and water. To avoid these problems, the ice water is pumped out from the mantle and returned to the customer's external ice water system. By pumping the ice water back to the external ice water system, there is also no waste.

When the ice water is removed from the mantle of the product tank, it is first collected in the [Water tank](#WaterTankwaterTank-F9FBDF76). When the water tank is full, the [Pump](#Pumppump-F9FBEA9A) starts up and returns the ice water to the external ice water system. When the level in the [Water tank](#WaterTankwaterTank-F9FBDF76) is low, the pump stops again.

### Trouble shooting 110305711/110305712

**Description**

When the ice water is removed from the mantle of the product tank it is first collected in the [Water tank](#WaterTankwaterTank-F9FC6923). When the water tank is full the [Pump](#Pumppump-F9FC73B4) starts up and return the ice water to the external ice water system. When the level in the [Water tank](#WaterTankwaterTank-F9FC6923) is low the pump stops again.

**Conditions to set the alarm**

If the [Pump](#Pumppump-F9FC73B4) runs continually for more than 60 seconds or if it starts and stops more than 15 times when draining the [Water tank](#WaterTankwaterTank-F9FC6923) the yellow alarm 110305711/110305712 occurs.

**Trouble shooting**

*   Make sure that all the valves are functioning correctly and are in the correct position.
    
*   Make sure that the pump is running correctly.
    
*   Make sure that the level probes in the [Water tank](#WaterTankwaterTank-F9FC6923) are functioning and are correctly set.
    
*   Make sure that the level relay is correctly set. The conductivity of the ice water media has an effect on the sensitivity of the system.
    
    \- If the [Pump](#Pumppump-F9FC73B4) runs continually for more than 60 seconds the R-value probably needs to be increased according to [Level Control Relay - Set](#section1770) or [Level Control Relay - Set](#section1771).
    
    \- If the [Pump](#Pumppump-F9FC73B4) starts and stops more than 15 times when draining the [Water tank](#WaterTankwaterTank-F9FC6923) the R-value probably needs to be decreased according to [Level Control Relay - Set](#section1770) or [Level Control Relay - Set](#section1771).

Logger SM1000
-------------

### Functional Description

The logger is part of the Installation to Performance (**ITP**) system.

The main function of the **ITP** system is to make sure that the different supply parameters to the machine are within the specified limits. The machine will only work at maximum efficiency if these specifications are met.

**Measured Parameters**

The measured supply systems are:

Supply system:

Measured parameters:

**CIP**

Return flow on side 1

Return flow on side 2

Return pressure on side 1

Return pressure on side 2

Ice water

Inlet flow

Inlet temperature

Product

Pressure on side 1

Pressure on side 2

Steam

Steam pressure

All of these measured parameters are continually recorded on a logger. This log can be used both on the logger itself and on a computer for more detailed analysis.

**Alarms**

If the measured parameters are outside of the specified limits, a blue or yellow alarm will be triggered. These alarms mean that something inside or outside of the machine must be corrected.

The alarm levels have been set so that the machine will function at maximum efficiency. If the specified parameters are not followed, the machine will malfunction and require more downtime.

**ITP Logger**

The **ITP** logger is situated in the filling section electrical cabinet and records all of the measured parameters on its memory card. This memory card has enough room to record continually for 15 months.

The log from the **ITP** logger can be used to diagnose the supply systems and to find the cause of any alarms that may occur. This diagnosis becomes much easier if you move the log files from the memory card to a computer, where you can use an add-in for Microsoft Excel to present the data in several different ways.

### Functional Description

The logger is part of the Installation to Performance (**ITP**) system.

The main function of the **ITP** system is to make sure that the different supply parameters to the machine are within the specified limits. The machine will only work at maximum efficiency if these specifications are met.

**Measured Parameters**

The measured supply systems are:

Supply system:

Measured parameters:

**CIP**

Return flow on side 1

Return flow on side 2

Return pressure on side 1

Return pressure on side 2

Ice water

Inlet flow

Inlet temperature

Product

Pressure on side 1

Pressure on side 2

Steam

Steam pressure

All of these measured parameters are continually recorded on a logger. This log can be used both on the logger itself and on a computer for more detailed analysis.

**Alarms**

If the measured parameters are outside of the specified limits, a blue or yellow alarm will be triggered. These alarms mean that something inside or outside of the machine must be corrected.

The alarm levels have been set so that the machine will function at maximum efficiency. If the specified parameters are not followed, the machine will malfunction and require more downtime.

**ITP Logger**

The **ITP** logger is situated in the filling section electrical cabinet and records all of the measured parameters on its memory card. This memory card has enough room to record continually for 15 months.

The log from the **ITP** logger can be used to diagnose the supply systems and to find the cause of any alarms that may occur. This diagnosis becomes much easier if you move the log files from the memory card to a computer, where you can use an add-in for Microsoft Excel to present the data in several different ways.

### Service Functions

Safety Hazard

Always reset all the functions and make sure that the machine is cleaned and sterilised before using the machine to produce packages.

The service functions bypass safeguards that have been put in place to ensure that the machine is run safely and that the packages that are produced are safe and hygienic for the consumer.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003526015.png)

The service function window contains several functions that will help you when servicing the machine. To reach it you turn the service key and to leave it you reset the key.

The functions in this window are meant to be used during service and it is very important that the machine is reset and cleaned before it is used in production again.

It is possible to leave the service function window at any time while the service key is turned. To return to the window you press the service function symbol that appears over the ladder. This symbol will always be shown as long as a service function is being used.

To use a function you click the field that you want to use and then use the buttons that appear to toggle between active and inactive.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003526014.png)

1

`Reset CIP/SIP` PLC Program – This function is used to terminate and reset the **PLC program** if the program has locked up or not been completed properly.

It is absolutely forbidden to use this function for service purposes or to stop a running CIP/SIP process.

2

`Reg. Valve` – This function is used when you service the regulator valve.

The regulator valve can not be disassembled unless it is fully open. This function opens the valve.

3

`Interlock SIP & Tankfilling` – It is normally not possible to step up to Tankfilling without first doing a SIP, or perform a **SIP** without first doing a **CIP**.

This function resets and sets the interlock between the Tankfilling /SIP and SIP/CIP . After the service function has been reset, a CIP is forced by the machine.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003526009.png)

4

`Override tank Level` – During service it is often necessary to run packages through the machine but it is not always possible to get product or water to the filling tank. This function makes the machine think that it has a full tank and you can then step up the machine and produce empty packages.

5

`Package section` – This function brings up the service window for the package section.

6

`Volume change` – This function aborts a volume change and can be used if a problem occurs during one.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003526016.png)

7

`Override DE` – During service it can be necessary to run the machine without running the DE equipment that it is connected to. This function makes it possible to run the machine only, without the DE equipment starting up.

8

`Water Test` - Particulate Filling Only. This function is used to load parameters, more suitable for filling water, to the filling system for test purpose.

9

`LFU` – This function brings up the service window for the LFU.

10

`TTCU` PLC Program – This function is used to terminate and reset the **PLC program** if the program has locked up or not been properly completed.

It is absolutely forbidden to use this function for service purposes or to stop a running TTCU process.

After the function has been reset the machine will not force the operator to run a new hygiene chamber cleaning sequence. It is important that this is done

11

`Pipe Drain` – This function drains the return pump and the pipes above the pump that are used during hygiene cleaning.

Contactor (2 kW)

**Condition during ignition phase**

Since the shutter is closed when the lamp is to be ignited, there is only current going through one of the 2 kW ballast coils. This current is too small to ignite the UV-lamp. The lamp needs current from both ballast coils (4 kW) to be ignited. To make this possible when the shutter is closed, control unit V51K1004 is used.

**Function of control unit V51K1004**

During the ignition phase of the UV-lamp, the control unit V51K1004 bypasses the shutter switch V51B1247 and activates contactor V51Q1014 (V51K1004:9). Together, contactor V51Q1013 and control unit V51K1004 make it possible to deliver 4 kW power to the UV-lamp.

During the ignition phase, when the intensity of the UV-lamp increases, control unit V51K1004 measures the increased voltage (V51K1004:6 and 7). When the voltage reaches a certain level, after about 10 to 20 seconds, control unit V51K1004 disconnects contactor V51Q1014. The UV-lamp power then goes down to 2 kW.

The red LED on control unit V51K1004 is lit during the ignition phase when contactor V51Q1014 is activated. When the correct voltage is reached after about 10 to 20 seconds, the LED goes off and contactor V51Q1014 is deactivated.

The ignition phase can also be observed by looking at the UV-lamp with the shutter closed.The UV-lamp will ignite and the intensity will increase during 10 to 20 seconds. The intensity will then drop when control unit V51K1004 disconnects contactor V51Q1014 and the UV-lamp power goes down to 2 kW.

After the ignition phase, the regulation of 2 kW or 4 kW power to the UV-lamp is controlled by shutter switch V51B1247. See Section [Normal Shutter Control](#section1780).

**Setting control unit V51K1004**

Control unit V51K1004 is set by the manufacturer when delivered. Normally it does not need any adjustment. But, since there are manufacturing tolerances between UV-lamps, it might be necessary to adjust the control unit V51K1004. See Procedure 7.2.2.4-1 Control Unit, 3060 - Set UV-lamp Limit.

### Normal Shutter Control

When the **UV** lamp is on and contactor V51Q1013 is activated, for example, during motor running, the V51B1247 shutter contact inside the UV-housing hardware controls the power of the lamp (half or full power) by switching contactor V51Q1014 ON and OFF.

**Shutter closed:** Only contactor V51Q1013 is activated, 2kW. The UV lamp is on half power.

**Shutter open:** Contactor V51Q1014 is activated by hardware and adds 2kW to the 2kW from contactor V51Q1013. The **UV** lamp is on full power, 4kW.

Hazardous voltage.

Be careful when measuring the voltage, and always measure the voltage when the lamp is already **On**. Never measure the voltage during the start of ignition.

Will shock, burn or cause death. The UV system generates very high voltage in the start of the ignition phase, when going from lamp **Off** to lamp **On**, igniterV51V1035 sends more than 1000V.

1.  Turn on the **UV** lamp with the `Package Disinfection` service function (See Chapter 2 Control Panels in the Operator Manual), or step the machine up to Motor On.
    
2.  Make sure that the UV-lamp is on.
    
3.  Leave the lamp on for at least 3 minutes, check that the UV Cooling Fan V51M1245 (F/C V51T1032) is running.
    
4.  Open the shutter with the `Package Disinfection` service function (see UV-lamp - Check Intensity), or override it in the **PLC** program.
    
5.  Check that the **UV** light is on.
    
6.  Make sure that contactors V51Q1013 and V51Q1014 are activated (4 kW).
    
7.  Make sure that contactor V51Q1017 is **not** activated (5 kW).
    
8.  Check the voltage between igniter V51V1035:D and V51V1035:L2. This is the voltage over the lamp. The voltage must be approximately 290V TrueRMS.
    

9.  Close the shutter.
    
10.  The **LED** on the control unit must be off , and contactor V51Q1014 must be off. (The control unit controls contactor V51Q1014 during the lamp ignition phase). If they are not off, turn the potentiometer to the left until the **LED** is turned off and contactor V51Q1014 goes off.
    
11.  Wait for at least 3 minutes.
    
12.  Make a new measurement on the lamp voltage. It must be approximately 260V TrueRMS.
    
13.  Turn the [Potentiometer](#Potentiometerptentiometer-D1DE4D6A) on the control unit (V51K1004) to the right until the [LED](#LEDLED-D1DE5A1E) turns on, and then turn the potentiometer to the left approximately 4 to 5 turns. (1 turn is approximately 7V).

Contactor (2 kW)

There are two LEDs on the current relay V51R0002, one green and one yellow.

The [Green LED](#GreenLEDgreenLED-5CB33BAE) is lit when current relay V51R0002 is connected to power. The [Yellow LED](#YellowLEDyellowLED-5CB345A6) is lit when current through the relay is higher than the set-point value.

The function of the current relay is to measure the current to UV-lamp when contactor V51Q1014 is engaged. When the contactor V51Q1014 is engaged, (shutter open or ignition phase) the [Yellow LED](#YellowLEDyellowLED-5CB345A6) is lit when the measured current is higher than the set-point value (I-value) and at the same time relay output is high (V51R0002:14).

As soon as the contactor V51Q1014 is disengaged the [Yellow LED](#YellowLEDyellowLED-5CB345A6) turns off and relay output goes low.

#### I/O Fault Codes

The controller indicates I/O faults on the status display in one of these formats:

• I/O Fault Local: _X #XXXX message_

• I/O Fault _ModuleName #XXXX message_

• I/O Fault _ModuleParent: X #XXXX message_

The first part of the format is used to indicate the location of the module with a fault. How the location is indicated depends on your I/O configuration and the properties of the module that are specified in Logix Designer application.

The latter part of the format, #XXXX message, can be used to diagnose the type of I/O fault and potential corrective actions.

### PLC Controller - Mark and Trace Local PLC Adaptations

Equipment Status

Program Step

Personnel Requirements.

Only authorised and skilled personnel are allowed to make changes in the **PLC** program.

Changing the **PLC** program can affect the machine in unexpected ways.

All local adaptations must, if possible, be made inside the program `LocalAdaptations`. Changes and adaptations that are not inside the `LocalAdaptations` program must be marked according to below.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000151901.png)

**Note:** For further information, see the Electrical Manual (EM).

1.  Mark the [Rung](#Rungrung-D25F4AA9), where the adaptation is, with the tag `LA_LocalAdaptation` to do a local adaptation in the **PLC** program. This tag is always on.
    
    In the example below, a main shaft position has been adjusted and marked with the `LA_LocalAdaptation` tag.
    

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002094102.png)

*   Rung

2.  To trace all local adaptations, make a cross reference on the `LA_LocalAdaptation` tag. A list over all positions where the tag is used in the program is displayed.
    
    The tag is created at the end of [MainProgram /MP\_SystemController routine](#MainProgramMP_SystemControllerRouti-D25F5B9E). Do not make changes in this rung.
    
    The tag is also used to mark the local alarms. See Section [Local Alarms](#LocalAlarms-18664732) below.
    

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002094101.png)

*   MainProgram /MP\_SystemController routine

3.  It is possible to make connections to and from the **PLC**. There are four inputs and four outputs that are reserved for local adaptations or customers local changes.
    
    The Inputs are connected to the A01X0206 terminal block (see the table below). The external connection must be connected to the A01X0206 terminal. The Inputs are not potentially separated from the rest of the machine.

### Distributed I/O

**Note:** Series mismatch.

When replacing a component that contains firmware, it is important that the components have the same series as the old ones.

**Note:** Revision mismatch.

It might be possible to use a component with a new revision, but it is recommended to use the same revision as the old one.

The series and revision is printed on the component.

### Functional Description

The communication and connections between different devices in the machine is provided through a DeviceNet network. The higher-level devices, such as controllers are connected to more simple devices such as sensors, actuators, and other parts.

In addition to reading the states of on/off sensors and operating motor starters, the DeviceNet network reports temperatures and the load current in the motor starter, changes the deceleration rates of drives, adjusts the sensitivities of sensors, and more.

### DeviceNet

In the TT/3 machine there are three DeviceNet networks, [DeviceNet 1](#DeviceNet1DeviceNet1-70D1D6F3), [DeviceNet 2](#DeviceNet2DeviceNet2-70D1E0E3), and [DeviceNet 3](#DeviceNet3DeviceNet3-70D1EABB). To see which DeviceNet node that belongs to which network, see the table that starts on page [Reference](NodeTrunkLineFuncNoNameSwitchPositi-19D56D6E).

A [Control Logix PLC](#ControlLogixPLCControlLogixPLC-D2D9C31F) and three [DeviceNet scanners 1756-DNB](#DeviceNetScanners1756-DNBDeviceNetS-D2D9D3E0) are installed in the electrical cabinet.

The [DeviceNet scanners 1756-DNB](#DeviceNetScanners1756-DNBDeviceNetS-D2D9D3E0) is a communication interface between the [Control Logix PLC](#ControlLogixPLCControlLogixPLC-D2D9C31F) and the DeviceNet network. The DeviceNet scanner scans the network and reads and writes data from and to the network nodes.

The logic **CPU** communicates with the Point I/O modules and the frequency converters through the three DeviceNet scanners A01K0030, A01K0031, and A01K0039. The DeviceNet scanners are located in place 3, 4, and 12 of the **CPU** rack in the electrical cabinet. From each scanner there are two trunk lines, one to the frequency converter in the electrical cabinet and one for the Point I/O and the frequency converter on the filling machine. A termination resistor must be connected between the blue and white connection on the end of each trunk line from the scanners.

The trunk line is the cable path between terminators that serves as the backbone of the DeviceNet network. The trunk line connects to taps or directly to devices. A tap is screw terminals that connect a drop line to the trunk line.

The modules that are connected to each scanner must have an individual address, a node number. The setting of the node numbers on the Point I/O (9 pieces of P I/O) modules is done on the [Thumb wheel](#ThumbWheelthumbWheel-D2DA5287) on the first **ADN** module. Setting of address number and baud rate, see section [DeviceNet Scanner Module - Set Address Number and Baud Rate](#section1845) on page [DeviceNet Scanner Module - Set Address Number and Baud Rate](#section1845).

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000365121.png)

*   Thumb wheel

**Note:** It is important that the modules are connected to the proper scanner. See the table below. The reciprocal order is not important since the modules are connected in parallel, but it is important that the last module in each loop have a termination resistor connected between the blue and white connection (121 Ohm, 1%, ¼ W).

### I/O Modules

DeviceNet nodes are placed on the machine modules such as Point I/O adapters (1734-ADN) and frequency converters (PowerFlex40), see the illustration below.

The Point I/O node signals are wired to the I/O modules.

I/O modules come in a wide range of different types. Digital, analogue, and thermocouple I/O modules are used in the TT/3 machine.

### Adapter (1734-ADN)

The adapter (1734-ADN) has double functionality. On the backplane it acts as an I/O scanner to the I/O modules and collects the I/O data. On the main DeviceNet it acts as an adapter, and data is collected by the 1756-DNB module.

There are different ways of communicating with the I/O modules. This means that there are different delay times compared to a non distributed I/O solution.

### PowerFlex40 (PF40)

PowerFlex40 (PF40) is a frequency drive on the DeviceNet. All of the drive parameters are downloaded from the DeviceNet scanner 1756-DNB when the drive is powered on.

### Status Indicators

On each DeviceNet node there are **LED**s; 1743-ADN indicators (1), PowerFlex40 indicators (2), and LED on I/O modules (3), indicating the status of the module and the network communication. It is possible to see on the **LED** if something is wrong with the network devices which simplifies maintenance and troubleshooting.

Each of the networks is connected to a separate 24 VDC power supply and has a terminating resistor (_TR_) (121 ohm), attached to the ends of the trunk line.

The [Drop line](#DropLinedropLine-D2DFE0A7) is the cable path that connects taps to nodes on the network.

The [Device box](#DeviceBoxdeviceBox-D2DFE9F3) is a junction box that allows two, four or eight drop lines to be connected to the trunk line via terminal strip connections.

The network cable is colour coded to avoid wiring faults:

### I/O Nodes - Set Baud Rate

Equipment Status

Power must be turn OFF.  

If the DeviceNet Scanner module has been in Run position with an incorrect baud rate setting, the **ADN** modules 24 V supply power (not the network power) must be disconnected and reconnected again to make a new automatic baud rate setting.

2.  Disconnect the 24 V connection cable from the **ADN** modules and reconnect it again.
    
3.  If this does not work, switch off A01F0062 (L11 24V) and A01F0066 (Class2 24V). Wait a few seconds before switching it on again.
    

### Frequency Converters - Change Parameter

Equipment Status

Program Step step zero

Special Equipment

CD with software  
Network cable

Personnel Requirements.

Only authorised and skilled personnel are allowed to change the parameters.

Changing the parameters can affect the machine in unexpected ways.

All parameters to the frequency converters are stored in the DeviceNet project and downloaded to the DeviceNet scanner.

The DeviceNet communication card in the frequency converter is internally supplied when the power (230-400VAC) to the frequency converter goes on.

All frequency converter comm cards have an individual node number for correct addressing of parameters to the frequency converters.

An automatic parameter transfer, from the DeviceNet scanner, is executed when the connection to the frequency converter comm card is established (the tree **LED**: PORT, MOD, and NET A has a steady green light).

If any parameter changes have been made manually on the buttons on the frequency converter, they will be restored to the values stored in the DeviceNet scanner when the frequency converter is supplied with power again.

If a single parameter has to be changed, or if the parameters to a frequency converter in the project have been set to factory setting, follow the procedure below. Look in the table for correct parameter values.

#### Upload the Current Parameters from the Frequency Converter to the Device Net Scanner Project on the Computer

1.  Open the DeviceNet file containing the frequency converter that will be changed.
    
2.  Make sure that the frequency converter has a power supply.

#### Preparations

The following preparations **must** be made:

*   DeviceNet files on the computer.
    
    *   Make sure that all NetWorx files are placed in the folder Networks, with the address: C:\\200v Program\\Projects\\Networks
        
    *   Before working with the files, make a backup of them. Save the backup in another folder on the computer in case of any fault during download.
        
    *   If the files are saved to the address above the function Associated Network… in the NetWorx software can be used. Using this function it is possible to jump between the **DNB** DeviceNet file and the **ADN** files related to this file.
        
*   Turn off the firewall.
    
    *   If there is a firewall installed on the computer, make sure that it is turned off.
        
*   Turn off the Logic **CPU**.
    
    *   Set the Logic **CPU** in step program.
        
    *   The indicator run goes off.
        
    *   Download of the DeviceNet configuration can **not** be done when the **CPU** is in step run.
        

#### Turn OFF the Main Power Supply Disconnector

Before rebuilding the Point I/O node, make sure that all 24 V supply is turned off.

Mains voltage:

*   Normal 24 V
    
*   Class II 24 V
    
    **Note:** It is recommended to turn off the main power supply disconnector Q001.
    

#### Rebuild the Point I/O Node

1.  Assemble the Point I/O node according to the new drawing.
    
2.  Make sure to put the correct type of bottom slices in the correct places.
    
3.  Make sure that the sheet metal shields between the bottom slices have contact with each other.
    
4.  Make sure to put the correct type of I/O module in the correct bottom slice.
    
5.  Make sure that the interlocking side pieces are in the correct position.
    

#### Turn ON the Main Power Supply Disconnector

1.  Turn on both the 24 V mains voltage and the Point I/O 24 V supply.
    
2.  Make sure that the top green **LED** in the **ADN** scanner and all the I/O modules are lit.
    
3.  At this point the Pointbus status indicator on the **ADN** scanner will be lit with a red light because the node differs from the old configuration that still remains in the **ADN** scanner (for example one I/O module has been added).
    

#### Start an Empty Project in RSNetWorx

1.  Start the RSNetWorx software or open an existing DeviceNet file.
    
2.  Click New to open a new empty project.

    Missing
    
    The device shown in the network configuration either is offline or it is **not** connected to the network.
    
    If the **ADN** scanner is marked with a Missing symbol it has **not** been found in the network. In this case take the following action:
    
    \- Disconnect from the network.
    
    \- Connect to the network again.
    
    \- Check if the `Missing` symbol has gone off.
    
    \- If the Missing symbol has **not** gone off:
    
    \- Close the project.
    
    \- Open the project.
    
    \- Connect to the network.
    
    \- Check if the `Missing` symbol has gone off.
    
    If neither of these actions makes the `Missing` symbol go off make sure that:
    
    \- the node is connected.
    
    \- the power to the node is turned on.
    
    \- the node address is correct.
    
    It is also important to check that there are 121 Ohm termination resistors placed in the correct positions in the network. See [Distributed I/O](#section1835), table on page [Distributed I/O](#section1835).
    

If one or several modules are marked with Missing symbols the reasons can be that:

\- the automatic re-numbering procedure is **not** finished.

\- the bottom slices are **not** correctly installed, the sheet metal shields are **not** in contact with each other.

In this case, disconnect from the network and then connect again.

It may be necessary to close the project, open it again and then connect to the network. But first make sure that the bottom slices are correct installed.

If this does **not** make the missing symbols go off, it is necessary to redo the automatic re-numbering procedure. Start over from [Start an Empty Project in RSNetWorx](#StartAnEmptyProjectInRSNetWorx-19DC68A3).

15.  If everything is correct, click Save to save the path to the node in the project and continue to [Download the New ADN Configuration](#DownloadTheNewADNConfiguration-19E01976).
    
    **Note:** When browsing the next time it is **not** necessary to point out the whole path.

**Clear an OverVoltage, UnderVoltage or Heatsink OvrTmp fault without restarting the drive.**

*   Set A541 \[Auto Rstrt Tries\] to a value other than “0”.
    
*   Set A542 \[Auto Rstrt Delay\] to “0”.
    

**Auto Restart (Reset/Run)**

The Auto Restart feature provides the ability for the drive to automatically perform a fault reset followed by a start attempt without user or application intervention. This allows remote or “unattended” operation. Only certain faults are allowed to be reset. Certain faults (Type 2) that indicate possible drive component malfunction are not resettable. Fault types are listed in the table Fault Types. See Fault Descriptions for more information.

Use caution when enabling this feature, since the drive will attempt to issue its own start command based on user selected programming.

### Servo System

**Note:** **Series mismatch.** When replacing a component that contains firmware, it is important that the components have the same series as the old ones.

**Note:** **Revision mismatch.** It might be possible to use a component with a new revision, but it is recommended to use the same revision as the old one.

The series and revision is printed on the component.

### Functional Description

The [PLC system](#PLCSystemPLCSystem-D353E03C) handles all functions for controlling the servomotors in the machine. The [Logic CPU](#LogicCPUlogicCPU-D353E873) executes the logic functions of the machine, that is, stepping up and down and the actions of pneumatic actuators, alarms and so on. The [Motion CPU](#MotionCPUmotionCPU-D353F2C1) executes the parts in the machine concerning motion, that is controlling the servomotors. The logic **CPU** and the motion **CPU** exchange information regarding ladder position, alarms, volume and bottom format.

The [Motion CPU](#MotionCPUmotionCPU-D353F2C1) communicates with the servo control cards, called [Sercos card 1](#SercosCard1sercosCard1-D354025A) and [Sercos card 2](#SercosCard2sercosCard2-D3540E5D) through the [Backplane](#Backplanebackplane-D3541A14) of the **PLC** rack.

The [Sercos card 1](#SercosCard1sercosCard1-D354025A) and [Sercos card 2](#SercosCard2sercosCard2-D3540E5D) communicates through an [Optical fibre network](#OpticalFibreNetworkopticalFibreNetw-D35428E7) with the [Servo rack](#ServoRackservoRacks-D3543040) containing the power supply and the [Servo drive](#ServoDriveservoDrives-D3543A12).

Through the [Power cable](#PowerCablepowerCable-D354413D) the drive provides power to the [Servomotor](#Servomotorservomotor-D3544923) and the motor position is sent to the drive through the [Feedback cable](#FeedbackCablefeedbackCable-D3544F90).

If the connected motor is equipped with a mechanical brake the brake function is integrated in the [Power cable](#PowerCablepowerCable-D354413D).

### Sercos Card

Sercos is a fibre-optic communication standard used for motion control. There are two Sercos cards in the TT/3 machine, [Sercos card (A9205)](#SercosCardA9205SercosCardA9205-D35D315F) and [Sercos card (A9206)](#SercosCardA9206SercosCardA9206-D35D3B0A) which control the [Servo rack](#ServoRackservoRacks-D35D45FC) of servo drives (10 [Additional servo drives for variant XH with IC](#AdditionalServoDrivesForVariantXHWi-D35D7F63)).

The Sercos cards and the drives are connected in a ring topology, see the illustration below. The card transmits data from the [Sercos transmit (Tx)](#SercosTransmitTxSercosTransmitTx-D35D53DD) port of the card or the drive, and receives data on the [Sercos receive (Rx)](#SercosReceiveRxSercosReceiveRx-D35D5BBB) port of the card or the drive. These ports are located on top of the drives, and on the bottom of the Sercos cards. For further information see section [Sercos Card](#section1867), page [Sercos Card](#section1867).

*   Sercos transmit (Tx)
*   Sercos receive (Rx)

*   Servo rack
*   Additional servo drives for variant XH with IC

Communication between the cards and the drives is performed at a certain speed, called baud rate. The [DIP switch](#DIPSwitchDIPSwitch-D35D669D) settings on the drives and software settings on the Sercos cards determine the baud rate. For further information see section [Servo Drive - Set Baud Rate](#section1872).

### Servo Rack

The Integrated Axis Module [IAM](#IAMIAM-D35E0A76) provides power to the [Servo drive](#ServoDriveservoDrives-D35E1173) in the [Servo rack](#ServoRackservoRack-D35E0155), and at the same time serves as a drive to one servomotor.

Each rack has a base node number, which is set by two [Switch](#Switchswitches-D35E1A84) on the IAM.

The rack is powered with 400 VAC at the [Power connector](#PowerConnectorpowerConnector-D35E20FC) on top of the IAM to run the servomotors.

Control power (240 VAC) to the drives in the rack is supplied through the [Control power connector](#ControlPowerConnectorcontrolPowerCo-D35E27F1) on top of the IAM.

A DC bus provides the drives in the rack with DC power through the backplane. If a slot in the rack is empty, a [Slot filler](#SlotFillerslotFiller-D35E301A), which prevents access to the DC bus power bar, is installed.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000264833.png)

### Servo Drive

Each servo drive has a node number which is determined by the base node number set on the IAM and numbered depending on which rack-slot the drive is located in.

The seven segment [Fault status LED](#FaultStatusLEDfaultStatusLED-D35E73AA) on the drive shows different code sequences depending on the status of the drive:

*   When the mains power is switched ON, the digits 1 and 2 are alternated. This is when parameters are sent from the Sercos card to the drives.
    
*   When displaying 3 a check is made to determine that the correct servomotor is connected to the drive.
    
*   At 4 the system is running.
    

Errors are displayed as an error message containing the letter E followed by two digits. An example of an error message sequence is E19: E – dark – 1 – dark – 9. This is the error code when the drive has tripped for Position error. For more information about the error codes, see [Servo System - General Troubleshoot](#section1863) on page [Servo System - General Troubleshoot](#section1863).

### Sercos - Troubleshoot

Equipment Status

Power must be turn OFF.  

Consumables

Cable ties

Machines that are equipped with Kinetix 6000 can sometimes have sporadic drive restarts or similar faults that are related to lost SERCOS communication.

Servomotors can cause the SERCOS ring drop fault if the shielding is not correctly clamped to the servo drive shield connector. This is valid mostly for servo drives with the old type of clamping.

Old clamp

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0001514509.png)

New clamp

If a fault is connected to SERCOS, follow the instructions:

2.  Check the connectors on all servomotor cables, especially grounding and shield connections.
    
3.  If hardware fault is suspected, exchange the hardware with a similar hardware in the machine. If the fault is transferred, replace the hardware. If the fault remains in the same place, change back again.
    
4.  Check all terminals that are related to the servo drive supply and safety. Check for loose wire and corrosion.
    
5.  Check all fibre optic cables. If there is any suspected damage or discontinuous bend on the radius, replace the cable. If the cable connectors are contaminated inside, clean or replace them.
    

5.  Rearrange the shield clamping on top of the drives even if it looks correct. See the illustration below. Make sure that there is contact between the cables.

7.  Check the diodes of the PLC SERCOS card and drives. If any suspected fault or unique behaviour, photograph or record the behaviour.
    

8.  For all drives, switch optical power to low intensity by setting [](#OpticalPoweropticalPower-3EED595D)to OFF.
    
9.  In the PLC software, select [](#SERCOS_Ring1A01K0032_SERCOS_Ring1-3EEF3569).
    
10.  In the [](#ModulePropertiesModulePropertiesWin-3EEF4D8E), change `Transmit Power` to [](#LowLow-3EEF6B10).
    
11.  Repeat item [Reference](InThePLCSoftwareSelect.-3EEF75AD) to [Reference](InTheChangeTransmitPowerTo.-3EEF8AB3) for [](#SERCOS_Ring2A01K0033_SERCOS_Ring2-3EEF94E8).

12.  Check the assembling of the servo drive. If the mounting screws are tightened and there is play, bend the upper hook on the drive to tighten it against the backplane. If necessary, replace the drive.
    
13.  Check the cable route, local adaptations, and the hardware changes on the drive systems (for example extra sensors or connections to drives). Document and try to assess the **EMC** compliance. If there is uncertainties, contact EMC specialists.
    
14.  Check the servomotor grounding and connectors. If there are abnormalities, repair or replace the connectors. Bayonet connectors can sometimes have mechanical play, use cable ties to reduce unwanted play.
    
15.  Measure the power supply to the machine, voltage fluctuations greater than 10% of nominal is not recommended.
    
16.  Make sure that the firmware on the **PLC** SERCOS communication card is revision 15.37 or higher.
    
17.  Check the firmware. The recommended firmware is ≥1.125 and <1.132.
    
    **Note:** Drives with firmware higher than 1.132, cannot be degraded again.
    

18.  Exchange the SERCOS cards in the main electrical cabinet. If the problem transfers to the other SERCOS ring, replace the PLCSERCOScard.
    

#### Further Faultfinding Troubleshoot

1.  Replace all fibre optic cables.
    
2.  Dismantle all drives. Check the backplane and the drive connectors for damage or contamination. Take a picture of the nameplate of the backplane and reassemble.

Safety System
-------------

### Functional Description

The emergency stop buttons and stop cords, are connected by two channels, one constant +24 VDC and one pulse shaped voltage from the safety **PLC** (Pluto). Both channels have to be opened and closed at the same time to allow the system to reset, however it is enough that one channel is open to make the system trip. The Adam/Eva safety switches for the doors are operating with one channel, the puls shaped voltage form the safety **PLC**. The system monitors the contactors that will be turned off when the system trip. If a feedback circuit is not OK after the system has tripped it is not possible to reset.

For more information about door guards and emergency stop buttons/cord see [Covers and Doors](#section2127) and [Emergency Stop Device](#section2133).

The [TTCU alarm symbol](#TTCUAlarmSymbolTTCUAlarmSymbol-D3C6201C) indicates that the **TTCU** Pluto system has not been reset. The symbol appears when the emergency stop button is activated or if there is an error message on the Pluto in the **TTCU**. The symbol only appears if a cleaning program is selected on the TT/3 machine, if not the **TTCU** warning lamp is red but there is no alarm on the TT/3 TPOP.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000152089.png)

*   **TTCU** alarm symbol

The [Safety system alarm symbol](#SafetySystemAlarmSymbolsafetySystem-D3C6314C) indicates that the system has not been restored despite that the **PLC** monitors all safety doors, and EMERGENCY STOP buttons and emergency stop cords are ok.

The reason for the alarm is probably the following:

*   Missing input or feedback signal to the Pluto system. Look for **UE**\-code on the Pluto displays (two Pluto modules in electrical cabinet and one in **ASU** electrical cabinet) and see Procedure [Pluto - UE-Code List TT/3](#section1889) on page [Pluto - UE-Code List TT/3](#section1889).
    
*   Fault code display on the Pluto system. Look for Er-code on the Pluto displays and see Procedure [Pluto B20 Troubleshooting - Fault Code List](#section1890) on page [Pluto B20 Troubleshooting - Fault Code List](#section1890).
    
*   Badly aligned and adjusted door guard sensors causing unstable signals to the Pluto and **PLC** system. See **LED** instruction below or setting Procedure [Safety Switch - Set](#section2129) on page [Safety Switch - Set](#section2129).
    
*   A tripped 24VDC fuse. Check fuses for XL11:1-8 or XL12:1-6 or XL21, XL22, XL31, XL32.

#### Reset Pulse from Relay to the Pluto System

In order to restore the safety system after an emergency stop, an open door or a safety system error, **UE** or **Er**\-code, the Pluto system need a 24 V on and off reset pulse to F03K0016:IQ14. The reset pulse comes from relay F03K0009. This is activated when restoring the emergency stop line or when acknowledging a door guard alarm on the **TPOP**.

If a Pluto module displays an **UE**\-code (safety system error) due to a channel fault or a feedback error, the faulted circuit must be corrected first, to be able to remove the **UE**\-code by a reset pulse.

#### Reset Relay F03K0009

If the **PLC** does not activate the reset relay it can be made manually. Pull down the blue [Cover shield](#CoverShieldcoverShield-1ADA5375) on relay F03K0009 with a small screwdriver and push the [Yellow button](#YellowButtonyellowButton-1ADA5375) underneath for a short while.

#### EDEN, Adam/Eva Sensors

Eden, Adam/Eva is a non-contact sensor with dynamic signal transmission (10 V pulse).

Several Eden connectors can be connected to the same safety circuit (Tina 4 A or Tina 8 A) and be monitored dynamically by the Pluto safety **PLC**.

An info signal (24 V) from each sensor is used in the **PLC** machine program for monitoring the individual doors on the machine.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000152086.png)

#### LED Indicator on Adam Sensor

For a stabile signal the distance between Adam and Eva sensors outer cover must be with accordance to the Procedure [Safety Switch - Set](#section2129) on page [Safety Switch - Set](#section2129).

#### Tina 4A and Tina 8A Connector Blocks

Door guards belonging to the same safety circuit are connected to the connector blocks.

Unused connections must be filled out with Tina 1A connectors to obtain the safety circuit signal through the block.

An info signal (24V) from each Adam/Eva sensor is distributed from the connector block to a **PLC** input and is used in the **PLC** machine program for monitoring the doors individually on the machine.

#### Termination resistors on the Pluto Bus

A 120 Ohm resistor must be connected between **CL** and **CH** terminals on the first and last Pluto module in the Bus.

If you have only one machine connected to a **TTCU** it means that the Pluto module in the **ASU** and the **TTCU** shall have a resistor. Resistors on the other Pluto modules must be removed for correct impedance on the Bus.

If you have two machines connected to one **TTCU** it means that the Pluto modules in **ASU** on both machines shall have a resistor. Resistors on the other Pluto modules must be removed for correct impedance on the Bus.

#### Comment on Inputs/Outputs on Pluto 27 (TTCU)

I0, I1

It is important that these two inputs, from Emergency Stops on the TTCU, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel fault will occur and the UE code 01 is displayed on the Pluto.

If UE code 00 is shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is permanent missing.

I2, I3

It is important that these two input, from External Emergency Stops to the TTCU, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel fault will occur and the UE code 03 is displayed on the Pluto. Permanent jumpers are connected to terminals if no external emergency stop is connected.

If UE code 02 is shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is permanent missing.

I4, I5, I6

Not used

I7

This feedback signal goes through and monitors the contactors that should be off when an emergency stop has been activated (button pushed. I0, I1 or I2, I3 is off). If everything is correct (contactors are off) the Input will be on (LED lit). The safety system can then be restored when the reset signal to Pluto 27: IQ11 goes on and off again.

If there is no signal to the I7 when an emergency stop has been activated the Pluto will show UE code 07 and the safety system can not be restored.

IQ10

Dynamic output pulse +10V (A-Pulse) created in the Pluto system.

IQ11

In order to restore the safety system in the TTCU after an emergency stop or safety system error (UE-code) the Pluto system need a 24V on and off pulse to this input. The reset pulse comes from relay F73K0202. This is activated from the reset button on the TTCU.

If a Pluto module displays an UE-code (safety system error) due to a channel fault or a feedback error, the faulted circuit must be corrected first, to be able to remove the UE-code by a reset pulse.

A reset pulse can also be made manually with a small screwdriver by pulling down the blue cover shield on relay F73K0202 and pushing the yellow button underneath for a short while.

#### Comment on Inputs/Outputs on Pluto 3 (23)

I0, I1

It is important that these two input, from emergency stops on the machine, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel fault will occur and the UE code 01 is displayed on the Pluto.

If UE code 00 is shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is permanent missing.

I2, I3

It is important that these two input, from external emergency stops to the machine, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel fault will occur and the UE code 03 is displayed on the Pluto. Permanent jumpers are connected to terminals if no external emergency stop is connected.

If UE code 02 is shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is permanent missing.

I4

This feedback signal goes through and monitors the contactors that should be off when an emergency stop has been activated (button pushed or a cord pulled. I0, I1 or I2, I3 is off). The signal also monitors the shut down of the filling servo rack #10 (safe off connections). If everything is correct (contactors and servo rack is off) the input will be on (LED lit). The safety system can then be restored when the reset signal to Pluto 4: IQ14 goes on and off again.

After reset the I4 will be off due to the fact that contactors and servo rack activates when the safety system for emergency stop restores.

If there is no signal to the I4 when an emergency stop has been activated the Pluto will show UE code 04 and the safety system can not be restored.

I5

This feedback signal monitors the UV-lamp contactors off state for S1.

HMI and PLMS
------------

### Functional Description

The **HMI** is the control software that is graphically represented on the touch screen as an interface for operating and controlling filling machines.

**PLMS** is the data management system for collecting, analysing, and monitoring the operational performance of filling machines and packaging lines.

**Note:** The NRG logger stops working if the communication between configured distribution equipment and TPOP breaks for some reason. For example, if:

*   TPOP is restarted when the distribution equipment is switched off.
    
*   the distribution equipment is restarted.
    
*   the distribution equipment loses power.
    

If this happens, make sure the configured distribution equipment is switched on, communication is re-established, and restart the TPOP. For instructions on how to check communication status, see Section PLMS NRG – DE Overview.

### HMI and PLMS - Update DASAbcip Software

Equipment Status

Program Step step zero

Special Equipment

CD with Software

The DASAbcip software is a communication server distributed by Wonderware and used to implement communication between the **TPOP** and the Rockwell RSLogix PLCs. Due to the introduction of RSLogix v19, the DASABcip server has to be version4.1Sp2. The TPOPBasic3.3 already implements this version of DASAbcip, but previous TPOPBasic3.1and3.2 do not (e.g. 3.2 contains Dasabcip 4.0.0).

A WinRar self-extracting archive contains the needed file to install the DASAbcip server and auxiliary software as MicrosoftC++ redistributable libraries and the Sentinel Protection. To simplify the installation, some specific parameters are automatically set by the installation procedure, which is implemented with an AutoItv3script.

#### Installation Procedure

1.  Log on as an installer on the TPOP. See Procedure [HMI and PLMS - Log on Procedure](#section1895).
    
2.  Self-extraction of the files into the folder .

Vision Unit
-----------

IVC Camera
----------

### Functional Description

The purpose of the vision system is to detect tilted screw caps (the torque supervision in the **CAU** will guarantee that the screw caps are properly tightened). The packages are scanned while passing the vision system on the conveyer. The system uses a laser beam and a camera to scan the packages. The reliability of the system will increase if the packages pass the vision system with a smooth movement.

Package scanning is activated by the photocell. If a screw cap is tilted, the pusher will push the package of the conveyer. If the package volume is changed the camera will automatically adjust to the new package height. The vision system uses the Ethernet cable to communicate with the **PLC**. Information about package volume are sent and **PLMS** data and alarms are being transmitted to the **PLC**.

The vision unit will make a reading when the photocell is activated. To read the next package the photocell must first be deactivated. Because of this there must be space between the packages. Normally there is space between the packages, but if the packages twist on the conveyer they will block the signal from the photocell and the reading will not be performed.

TriSpector Camera
-----------------

TT3 2000

### Functional Description

The purpose of the vision system is to detect tilted screw caps (the torque supervision in the **CAU** guarantees that the screw caps are correctly tightened). The packages are scanned while passing the vision system on the conveyor. The system uses a laser beam and a camera to scan the packages. If the packages pass the vision system with a smooth movement, the reliability of the system increases.

Package scanning is activated by the photocell. If a screw cap is not correctly attached, the pusher pushes the package off the conveyor. The vision system uses the Ethernet cable to communicate with the **PLC**. Information about package volume is sent and **PLMS** data and alarms are being transmitted to the **PLC**.

The vision unit makes a reading when the photocell is activated. To read the next package, the photocell must first be deactivated. Because of this, there must be space between the packages. Normally there is space between the packages, but if the packages twist on the conveyor, they block the signal from the photocell and the reading is not performed.

Electrical Cabinet
------------------

### Functional Description

The **TTCU** is connected to the TT/3 filling machine Pluto safety system and it communicates with the TT/3 filling machine control system using DeviceNet. The **TTCU** can be connected to two TT/3 filling machines, but can only supply cleaning/disinfection solution to one machine at the time.

When cleaning/disinfection is selected on one of the TT/3 filling machines’ **TPOP**, the **TTCU** Pluto safety system sends a signal to the Pluto safety system in the other TT/3 filling machine stating that the **TTCU** is **not** idle. That signal is used to block the selection of the cleaning/disinfection on that TT/3 filling machine’s **TPOP**. The Pluto safety system also switches the **TTCU** DeviceNet between TT/3 filling machines.

The TT/3 filling machine that has connection with the DeviceNet loop in **TTCU** can perform cleaning/disinfection, that means that the **TTCU** can be considered as one node that is shared between the TT/3 filling machines.

For more information and procedures see chapter [Electrical System](#section1754).

Before using the socket outlet always check the residual current device, see Section [Residual Current Device - Check](#section1768).

Logger SM1000
-------------

### Functional Description

The logger presents the conductivity, temperature, and flow of the cleaning solution supplied to the TT/3 filling machine on its monitor. As the **TTCU** can support two TT/3 filling machines, the logger also shows which of the two machines the unit supplies cleaning solution to.

### Measured Parameters

The measured parameters are recorded on the logger when the cleaning program is chosen on the **TPOP**, and the **TTCU** is in operation. The logger stores all of the measured parameters on its memory card.

The memory card has enough room to record continuously for 15 months. The log from the logger can be used to diagnose the cleaning systems and to find the cause of any malfunction of the unit. The diagnosis can be done on a **PC**. The log files can be moved from the memory card to a computer, where an add-in for Microsoft Excel can be used to present the data in several different ways.

### Alarms

If the measured parameters are outside of the specified limits, a yellow alarm will be triggered.

Logger RVG200
-------------

### Functional Description

The logger presents the conductivity, temperature, and flow of the cleaning solution supplied to the TT/3 filling machine on its monitor. As the **TTCU** can support two TT/3 filling machines, the logger also shows which of the two machines the unit supplies cleaning solution to.

### Measured Parameters

Parameter

Unit

Conductivity

mS/Cm

Temperature

°C

Flow

m3

Machine

20XXX or 20YYY

The measured parameters are recorded on the logger when the cleaning program is chosen on the **TPOP**, and the **TTCU** is in operation. The logger stores all of the measured parameters on its memory card.

The memory card has enough room to record continuously for 15 months. The log from the logger can be used to diagnose the cleaning systems and to find the cause of any malfunction of the unit. The diagnosis can be done on a **PC**. The log files can be moved from the memory card to a computer, where an add-in for Microsoft Excel can be used to present the data in several different ways.

### Alarms

If the measured parameters are outside of the specified limits, a yellow alarm will be triggered.

Granulate Supply Unit

See [Granulate Supply Unit](#section2090)

### Functional Description

See OM for more information about the **GSU** such as Control Panel, and alarms and troubleshooting.

The granulate supply unit (**GSU**) is a supply unit to the filling machine that consists of a [Central granulate unit](#CentralGranulateUnitcentralGranulat-94EE3D3A) and a [Granulate container](#GranulateContainergranulateContaine-94EE5E70). The [Granulate container](#GranulateContainergranulateContaine-94EE5E70) is available in different sizes. Also a [Granulate hopper](#GranulateHoppergranulateHopper-94EE6BB2) is needed to balance the distribution.

The [Central granulate unit](#CentralGranulateUnitcentralGranulat-94EE3D3A) and the [Granulate container](#GranulateContainergranulateContaine-94EE5E70) can be placed up to 50 m from the filling machine, while the [Granulate hopper](#GranulateHoppergranulateHopper-94EE6BB2) is connected to the filling machine.

The **GSU** provides the filling machine with a vacuum pressure allowing the filling machine to collect granulate. One **GSU** can serve up to eight filling machines at the same time.

When a signal is transmitted from a filling machine to the **GSU**, the fan starts. A vacuum [Valve](#Valvevalve-94EE7406) shifts at the same time the fan starts, changing the direction of the airflow to clean the [Filter](#Filterfilters-94EE788B). The valve shifts back a few moments later building up a vacuum. During the automatic cleaning of the [Filter](#Filterfilters-94EE788B), some granulate and dust is gathered in the [Plastic bag](#RubberBellowsrubberBellows-94EE8187) below the [Filter](#Filterfilters-94EE788B).

To pretension stainless and acid-resistant screw connections, effective lubrication is required. Otherwise the threads will seize. The values in the table refer to waxed products. Lubrication with molybdenum sulphide (MoS2) gives a similar friction ratio to wax, which means that the table can be used. Table values apply to screw connections when using a torque wrench or tenacious screw/nut driver with torque control. Max torque spread on tool is +/-5%.

Apply the required prestressing force to a screw joint reinforcement, tighten screws, nuts, and so on, according to the tightening torque table, unless otherwise stated.

#### Tightening

**Note:** Torques are translated into degrees of a revolution.

*   Previously used cones:
    
    *   Torque the bushing to 90°.
        
*   New cones:
    
    *   Use a higher torque to tighten the bushing to compensate for the reduction of the cone when it is used for the first time.
        
*   Bushings/venting plugs without cones:
    
    *   Torque to 90°.
        

#### Assembling

1.  Make sure that the ends of the hoses/pipes are clean and cut at a 90° angle.
    
2.  Lubricate the cones.
    
3.  Connect the hoses/pipes. Make sure that they touch the bottom of the seat.
    
4.  Use a spanner to tighten the bushing against the cone until it is tight. Finnish the assembly by tightening the bushing to the first time or reassembling angle according to the table below.

### Power Failure - Start Up

Equipment Status

Power must be turn ON.  

#### Description

The **TPOP** restarts and the window below appears:

*   after the first startup of the machine.
    
*   after the power has been cut off.
    
*   if any of the **PLC** has been stopped.
    

The upper part of the window serves as a confirmation for the operator/technician. It confirms that the volume washers in the cassettes are positioned as stated in respectively text boxes. See [Volume Change Mechanism - Check](#section1491) on page [Volume Change Mechanism - Check](#section1491) for more information.

The lower part of the window serves as a remainder to check that the positions of the servomotors are OK. The box can be ticked before or after the positions are checked. The reason that the positions have to be checked is that the shown axes cannot perform their homing automatically and have to be manually checked.

### CIP Concentration of Cleaning Solution

The following instructions describe how to check the concentration of detergent solutions used in **CIP**. The check is made either by measuring the electrical conductivity of the detergent solution or by using the titration method.

### CIP Concentration of Cleaning Solution – Check Using Electrical Conductivity Method (Technician)

Equipment Status

Program Step

Special Equipment

Soft cloth  
Open vessel (Ø 150 mm)

Electrical conductivity depends on the temperature and increases when temperature rises due to increased molecular motion.

In the conductivity meter, the temperature compensation is done automatically so the measurement is accurate regardless of the temperature of cleaning solution.

The measured electrical conductivity is related to the concentration in a calibration curve. The illustration shows the conductivity for the three most common cleaning chemicals as a function of concentration at 25°C.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0002067548.png)

Conductivity versus concentration at 25°C

Hazardous substances.

Contact with chemicals could be hazardous to your health. Wear safety glasses and protective gloves when removing the conductivity sensor from the tank.

2.  Collect a sample of the alkali cleaning solution that is used during **CIP**.
    
3.  Remove the [Conductivity meter](#ConductivityMeterconductivityMeter-E958845B) from the [TTCU tank](#Tanktank-E958EDC9) by removing the [Clamp](#Clampclamp-E958F4B6) and the [Gasket](#Gasketgasket-E9590D69).
    
4.  Rinse the [Sensor](#Sensorsensor-E95920A9) thoroughly with plenty of water.
    
5.  Use a clean soft cloth to wipe off the sensor.
    
6.  Use the open vessel for the sample of cleaning solution and immerse the conductivity sensor in the sample.
    
    *   Make sure that the sensor is submerged completely in the solution.
        
    *   Make sure that the sensor is placed in the middle of the container, minimum 15mm from the edge.

### CIP Concentration of Cleaning Solution – Check Using Titration Method (for Pure Chemicals Such as Sodium Hydroxide and Nitric Acid) (Laboratory Assessment)

Special Equipment

Titration burette  
10ml pipette  
Beaker

Consumables

Hydrochloric acid (HCl)  
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)  
Phenolphthalein 5% solution (alcohol based)

In titration, the neutralisation reaction between an acid and a base, is utilised. A certain volume of the test solution (for example, nitric acid solution) is metered into a beaker. A titre solution (for example, sodium hydroxide solution of a known concentration) is added to the test solution until it becomes neutral. An indicator is added to the test solution to determine when the solution is neutral. Phenolphthalein indicator changes colour about pH7 and is therefore commonly used for acid/base titration.

The test solution concentration can be calculated based on the titrant volume that is used, titrant concentration, and test solution volume.

The test solution concentration can also be obtained by using titration diagrams.

#### Titration of NaOH, HNO3 and H3PO4 Solutions

Test solution

10ml

Titre Solution

0.1 mole/l or 1 mole/l HCl for an alkaline solution

0.1 mole/l NaOH for an acid solution

Indicator

Phenolphthalein 5% solution (alcohol based)

For recommended concentrations, see Section [Chemicals for Cleaning and Disinfection](#section2117).

1.  Collect a 10ml sample of the alkali or acid cleaning solution that is used during **CIP**.
    
2.  Add three to five drops of the indicator solution to the test solution.
    
3.  Titrate with the titre solution until a colour change is seen.
    
    The colour changes from colourless to pink for an acid solution.
    
    The colour changes from pink to colourless for an alkaline solution.
    
4.  Calculate the concentration using the information in Sections [Calculation](#Calculation-EAD1C3A6) or use the [Titration Diagrams](#TitrationDiagrams-EAD1D9E4).
    

#### Calculation

*   _NaOH-concentration =_
    
    _x_ = the volume, in ml, of 0.1mole/l HCl used to obtain a colour change, when 10ml NaOH solution is titrated.
    
*   _NaOH-concentration =_
    
    _y_ = the volume, in ml, of 1mole/l HCl used to obtain a colour change, when 10ml NaOH solution is titrated.
    
*   _HNO_
    
    _z_ = the volume, in ml, of 0.1mole/l NaOH used to obtain a colour change, when 10ml HNO3 solution is titrated.
    
*   _H_
    
    _v_ = the volume, in ml, of 0.1mole/l NaOH used to obtain a colour change, when 10m1 H3PO4 solution is titrated.

Safety System Description
-------------------------

### About the Safety System Description Chapter

This chapter contains information about the Safety System.

### General

Risk of death or serious injury.

To ensure the performance of the safety related parts of the control system, any modifications must be performed such that there is no change in the status and integrity of the categories or performance levels of the applied safety functions.

Any modifications that change the different categories or performance levels of the applied safety functions can lead to a dangerous failure in the safety system. The machine is equipped with a safety system containing emergency stops, interlocking door guards, and so on. Categories and performance level of the separate functions are given in Section [Emergency Stop and Safety Zones in the Machine](#section2156).

### Description of System

The safety system of the TT/3 is managed by the safety PLC:s. See the PLC table in Section [List of Safety Components](#section2151). The safety relay expansion modules are listed in the Relay Expansion Modules table in Section [List of Safety Components](#section2151).

The machine is divided into several safety zones. When a door in any safety zone is opened, a signal is sent to the safety PLC, which will then take actions to put that zone into a safe state.

When any emergency stop button is pressed on the machine, all the safety zones are put into a safe state.

### List of Safety Components

All components included in the safety system are listed in this section.

Risk of death or serious injury.

All safety components which are included in the safety system must be replaced with those components which are designated in the Spare Parts Catalogue.

Replacement of safety components, which are included in the safety system, with components that are not designated in the Spare Parts Catalogue, can lead to a dangerous failure in the safety system.

Fault Exclusions
----------------

### General

The integrity of the safety system is based on the fault exclusions given in the following subsections.

Risk of death or serious injury.

Ensure that all the listed conditions for the fault exclusion are fulfilled.

Altering the conditions given in the fault conditions will lead to a hazardous situation.

### Fault Exclusion Short Circuit Inside Cabinet

A fault exclusion has been made inside the electrical cabinet for short-circuits between conductors.

To maintain the justification and the safety performance level, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

*   The electrical cabinet must be kept locked, with access restricted to skilled or instructed persons.
    
*   The protective bonding circuit must be maintained.
    
*   The degree of protection of the electrical cabinet must not be reduced so that there is a risk of ingress of water or dust below the prior level of protection.
    
*   The lids of the cable ducts must be restored after maintenance.
