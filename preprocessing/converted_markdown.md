### TPMS

 **TPMS** is the maintenance methodology to handle all maintenance-related
work processes from development and the whole life cycles for TetraPak®
equipment. The **TPMS** methodology is reliability-centred (best industry
practice) and aims at finding the right combination of predetermined,
condition-based, and corrective maintenance. In maintenance, the challenge is
to find the right level of investment in parts and labour effort to achieve
the desired performance, quality, and reliability. Thanks to **TPMS** , it is
possible to create maintenance plans with a good balance between what is
invested and what it received in return.[//]: # (Start of section about How
TPMS Works)

### How TPMS Works

Users around the globe continuously feed the system with maintenance data. The
data is continuously evaluated and then utilised to improve maintenance
recommendations and customer-specific scheduling of maintenance tasks.
**TPMS** takes a holistic approach to maintenance by including the actions
needed to contribute to plant efficiency. With this advanced maintenance
management tool, the maintenance checklists are designed to include latest
updates of our recommendations to meet the demands for fewer unscheduled
stops, reduced waste, and less interference with production.[//]: # (Start of
section about TPMS Maintenance Recommendation Overview)

### TPMS Maintenance Recommendation Overview

With the TetraPakGroup's extensive experience of managing maintenance on
TetraPak® packaging lines, together with our advanced maintenance management
tools, we can support you in tailoring the right maintenance plans
(checklists) to follow the maintenance system in a consistent way. Using
**TPMS** is a foundation to having your equipment run at its best. Checklists
can be managed and delivered directly from your local TetraPak service
station. In the checklist you will find information concerning what tasks
shall be done and when they shall be done. Furthermore, the document reference
will give guidance as to how to perform the work. The document references are
**MM** , **SPC** , **OM** , **RM** , **EM** , and **TeM**.[//]: # (The image
below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in
text))

 **Note:** The layout of the checklist is subject to change.For those
customers that intend to set up their own maintenance system and plans, the
TetraPakGroup can on a upon-request basis provide a maintenance recommendation
overview for the specific equipment, including tasks required to keep the
equipment in good condition. The recommendation will be provided free of
charge for up to a year after delivery.The following items can be found in the
maintenance recommendation overview:Task Code| Trade| Task Action| Task

### Safeguards

Moving machinery parts.Never defeat or bypass the interlocking devices.

Movable guards, for example, doors and covers leading to hazardous zones, are
fitted with interlocking devices where required. These devices are usually
electric safety switches that are parts of the safety system and must never be
defeated, bypassed, or otherwise made inoperative.Where movable guards (doors)
are equipped with means to be locked in a nonclosed position, any person with
the intention to preside, for any reason, behind such a guard must lock the
guard in the nonclosed position by use of a padlock. **Note:** For work on the
electrical equipment, the electrical power must also be disconnected.

Equipment damage.The equipment can be damaged if it is not stopped in the
correct way. Never stop this equipment by opening a movable guard, for
example, a door or cover, equipped with an interlocking device.

The location of each interlocking device is shown by an arrow.[//]: # (The

  * protective apron (for instance, TP No. 90303-13), or protective suit when handling larger amounts
  * protective shoes or boots made of PVC, PE plastic, or rubber
  * proper respiratory equipment, if ventilation is insufficient

[//]: # (Start of section about Handling of Hydrogen Peroxide)

### Handling of Hydrogen Peroxide

Chemical hazard.Avoid any contamination of hydrogen peroxide.Sudden and
violent chemical reaction.

Hydrogen peroxide can react very suddenly and violently in combination with
many compounds, or if it is contaminated. Never pour surplus hydrogen peroxide
back into the original container. There is a risk of a violent decomposition
liberating oxygen and heat, with a big increase in volume due to the oxygen
generated by the peroxide decomposition. This will cause a large overpressure
if the contaminated hydrogen peroxide is in a closed container. If the
integrity of the container fails, this could result in a dangerous
hazard.Ensure that equipment used for handling and diluting hydrogen peroxide
is clean before it comes in contact with hydrogen peroxide. Pumps or other
equipment used for handling hydrogen peroxide must be **used for this purpose
only** and must be manufactured from appropriate materials, such as stainless
steel 316 L, glass, polyethylene, or teflon. After use, make sure that all
peroxide residue is rinsed away.If hydrogen peroxide is spilled, dilute it
with large amounts of water. Dispose of the diluted hydrogen peroxide
according to local regulations.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate
the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000028990.png)

Chemical hazard.Never wipe up hydrogen peroxide with materials such as rags or
paper as these may self-ignite several hours after contact. If there is a
fire, spray with large quantities of water.Risk of self-ignition.

[//]: # (Start of section about Storage of Hydrogen Peroxide)

### Storage of Hydrogen Peroxide

Chemical hazard.Keep the container upright and fitted with its proper
ventilation cap. If there is a fire, cool all containers by spraying them with
large quantities of water.Containers may become overpressurised if they are
not properly ventilated. If the integrity of a container fails, this could
result in a dangerous hazard.

Hydrogen peroxide decomposes much faster with increasing temperature. There is
a risk of a container becoming overpressurised at high temperatures, since the
ventilation cap cannot release the gases produced quickly enough. If the
integrity of the container fails, this could result in a dangerous
hazard.Hydrogen peroxide **must** be stored in the **original container**
delivered by the supplier. Keep the container upright and fitted with its
proper ventilation cap, which allows oxygen to escape. Otherwise there is a
risk of overpressurisation of the container due to violent decomposition of
the peroxide. If the integrity of the container fails, this could result in a
dangerous hazard.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in
the procedure (explained above in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000028989.png)

Make sure that the container is always properly closed.Commercial food-grade
hydrogen peroxide has been stabilized to inhibit the catalytic decomposition
effects of metals and other impurities, but it can decompose into oxygen and
water if it is exposed to heat or contaminated.

  * cool, clean, and well ventilated
  * shielded from direct sunlight
  * kept free from combustible materials

### Definition of Lockout Procedure

A lockout procedure is a procedure to put each necessary energy isolating
device in its safe position to prevent the energisation of the equipment, such
as when a maintenance procedure should be carried out.A lockout is the use of
a device, for example, a padlock, to make sure that an energy isolating device
cannot be operated.An energy isolating device is a mechanical device that
physically prevents transmission or release of energy, such as an electrical
supply disconnecting device.When a utility should be LOCKED in the OFF
position according to the Equipment Status row of a Procedure Start Table, the
lockout procedure for that utility is applicable.A detailed instruction for
the specific lockout procedure(s) for this equipment is found in the General
chapter of the Maintenance Manual, or the General section of the Maintenance
Instructions chapter of the Technical Manual.[//]: # (Start of section about

[//]: # (Start of section about Equipment for Lifting and Moving Loads)

### Equipment for Lifting and Moving Loads

Risk of crushing.Make sure that the capacity of the lifting equipment is
adequate and that the equipment itself is in proper working order.The
equipment can be heavy and can cause injury and death if it falls.

If lifting tackle must be joined to make up the necessary lengths, make sure
that the joints are secure and have the same lifting capacity as the rest of
the lifting tackle.Always engage safety clips fitted to lifting hooks to
prevent the lifting tackle from slipping off.Use ropes or poles to steady and
manoeuvre suspended loads. Do **not** use hands or feet.Make sure that the
route and destination are free from obstacles before moving a suspended load.
It must always be possible to quickly and safely lower the load to the floor
in an emergency.When depositing loads, keep lifting tackle in place until the
stability of the load has been substantiated.[//]: # (Start of section about
Working at Height)

### Working at Height

This equipment is provided with a means of access to all locations where
routine tasks for operation and maintenance need to be carried out.

Risk of falling.For any kind of work at height, always ensure that safe means
of access is available and used. Where additional safe means of access other
than provided with the equipment is required, follow local work at height
regulations and guidelines. Use scaffolds or a mobile work platform and a
safety harness. Create a safety perimeter around the working area and secure
tools or other objects from falling.

[//]: # (Start of section about Nitrogen)

### Nitrogen

Chemical hazard.Provide good ventilation or local exhaust to prevent
accumulation of high concentrations of gas. Oxygen levels in the work area
must be monitored to ensure that they do not fall below 19.5%. To ensure
enough oxygen concentration in the ambient air, establish an oxygen monitoring
system. Consult your local authority regarding regulatory requirements. An
oxygen monitoring system is not included in the TetraPak® supply.Risk of death
or personal injury. Nitrogen is a nontoxic, odourless, colourless,
nonflammable compressed gas, which can cause rapid suffocation at high
concentrations. Contact with skin can cause frostbite. Inhalation of cold gas
can damage the lungs. Risk of explosion of equipment/pipes due to pressure
increase, when nitrogen expands from a fluent to gas state.

[//]: # (Start of section about Confined Space)

### Confined Space

Confined space.Assess the hazards, ensure the training of the personnel,
ensure appropriate equipment for rescue operations are in place and that
personnel know how to use it, and use lockout procedures whenever
appropriate.Risk of severe injury or death from entering or working in a
confined space in the equipment. Entering or working in a confined space may
result in the necessity for a rescue operation, which is time consuming and if
not planned and executed properly, can introduce new risks.

  * loss of consciousness from the rise in body temperature
  * contact with media or chemicals
  * unexpected start-up of the equipment
  * the nature of the work that is performed
  * ingress of gases

Loss of consciousness or reduced mobility that is caused by incident or
disease (for example stroke or cardiac arrest) will lead to rescue operations
that are time-consuming and require dedicated skills and equipment.To avoid
risk of injury, avoid working in a confined space whenever possible. Adopt
alternative methods that allow work to be done remotely or from outside the
confined space. Work in a different manner that avoids the risk whenever it is
reasonably practical to do so.Should work within the confined space be
necessary, ensure that local workplace health and safety legislation and site
operating procedures for working in confined spaces are complied with.

  * site operating procedures for confined spaces are missing
  * necessary rescue equipment is missing
  * all involved personnel have not been trained

Contact the TetraPakGroup, or seek other competent guidance.For TetraPak®
personnel and contractors, the Procedure for Confined Spaces and local
Standard Operating Procedures apply.[//]: # (Start of section about Product
Pressure)

### Product Pressure

Risk of personal injury.To avoid exposure, make sure that skilled personnel
carry out the appropriate action.There is a risk of injury due to equipment
parts in motion, or exposure to gas or liquids under pressure, caused by
residual pressure in the pressurised equipment if the equipment has not been
depressurised fully.

The vaporised hydrogen peroxide from the pre-treatment evaporators is lead
through hoses and out the peroxide spray nozzles inside the Pre-treatment box.
See also Chapter Carton Section. The Pre-treatment box collect and transport
the excessive vaporised hydrogen peroxide to the Condenser where the hydrogen
peroxide vapour condensates and is lead to the Buffer tank on side 2 of the
**ASU**. **Note:** The hydrogen peroxide from the condenser has a
concentration of >3%.The tank is provided with a Float switch, making sure
that the Buffer tank is partially filled with water. During production, the
buffer tank will be filled with hydrogen peroxide to a certain point. When the
float switch has reached that level, more water will be added to dilute the
hydrogen peroxide to a concentration of <3%. The buffer tank is then
drained.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the
procedure (explained above in text))

### Sleeve Size Guideline

This chapter is a guideline to adjusting the sleeve size. Some of the
adjustments mentioned here are also available in other chapters, for example
in 2.4.2-3 Conveyor - Basic Setting of Vertical Position - Folding Pipes,
2.4.3-4 Sleeve Forming Unit - Fine Adjust Top Size - Sleeve, and 2.4.3-5
Sleeve Forming Unit - Set Bottom and Top Size for Sleeve.[//]: # (Start of
section about General)

### General

There are different parameters that affect the sleeve size. In this guideline
the focus is on the parameters with largest impact on the sleeve size. They
are: creasing roller distance, distance between squeezer roller and conveyor
belt, distances between folding pipe bracket and conveyor belt (rear and
front) and dial.See descriptions and illustrations in Chapter Initial
Settings.[//]: # (Start of section about Prerequisites)

### Prerequisites

### Graphical Representation of Responses

In the following graph, the setting value is represented by the vertical
lines. The top sleeve size and the bottom sleeve size are represented by the
horizontal lines.When moving the setting value left or right, the intersection
between the setting value and the sleeve size follows the graphs.When moving
from the Original setting value to the New setting value in the graph, the
sleeve sizes move from Original bottom sleeve size to Smaller bottom size and
Original top sleeve size to Smaller top size respectivelyThe following example
shows what response is to be expected when lowering the parameter “Dial”.[//]:

 **Note:** The carrier belt must be aligned before measuring.To achieve
correct belt tension, apply a force of 25-35N to the centre point of the belt.
If the deflection distance is 6.5mm, the belt has the correct
tension.![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003130130.png)The
following method is a way to perform this setting.

    1. Make sure that the belt does not slack.
    2. Measure the distance **A** between the beam and the carrier belt, at the Centre point.
    3. Calculate thickness **C** (subtract 6.5 from **A** ).
    4. Find a feeler gauge with the calculated thickness **C**. Insert the feeler gauge between the carrier belt and the beam, at the Centre point.
    5. Use a dynamo metre to apply a force of **25N** to **35N** at the Centre point of the carrier belt. When applying the force, the belt must be in contact with the feeler gauge, but the feeler gauge must be easy to remove.
    6. If adjustment is necessary, loosen the Screw and the Lock nut on both sides of the carrier belt. For Base machines, the Screw must also be loosened.
    7. Use the Screw to adjust the carrier belt tension and then repeat item [Reference](MeasureTheDistanceABetweenTheBeamAn-0EFD6DAB) to [Reference](UseADynamoMeterToApplyAForceOf25NTo-0EFD7AAF).
    8. Make sure that the distance **B** is equal on both sides of the carrier belt. **Note:** The carrier belt must be aligned and must not wander.
    9. Tighten the Screw, Screw, and the Lock nut.

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Raise the upper forming plate halves (can be locked in raised position with the aid of an Allen key through the hole in one of the Locking block support and above the Erector frame).
    2. Remove the Shim from both ends from the lower forming plates. Put the Screw for the forming plates back and tighten them loosely.
    3. Put the Template (MIN-end directed to the mandrel) in each lower forming plate. The Template must stop in the bottom of the dummies for the internal tool. **Note:** The templates for MiniV only have a MIN-end and can not be turned.
    4. Hold one of the templates in position and measure the distance between the lower forming plate and the Template, in both the front and the rear end, with a feeler gauge. Repeat the procedure for the other lower forming plate.
    5. Remove the templates and put shims according to the thickness measured above. Tighten the Screw.
    6. Repeat items [Reference](PutTheMIN-endDirectedToTheMandrelIn-1AB2AC73) to [Reference](RemoveTheTemplatesAndPutShimsAccord-1AB2B189), using both ends of the Template, MAX respectively MIN. If MAX does not fit, more, or less shims are necessary. **Note:** The templates for MiniV only have a MIN-end and can not be turned.

    8. If the setting cannot be achieved, do the following adjustments.
      * In the Y-direction: Loosen the Screw and move the forming plates in chosen direction.
      * In Z -direction: If the difference between front and rear edges of the forming plates (against templates) exceeds ±0.1mm, adjust the Setting screw and the Setting screw. Do not forget to slack off the Nut, the Nut, and the Nut.
      * In Z-direction: If there is a difference between left and right forming plate, measure the distance and add Shim under both ends of one forming plate. Tighten the Screw, the Screw, the Screw, and the Screw. Tighten the Nut, the Nut, and the Nut to 30Nm and check the parallellity once more.

#### Set Upper Forming Plates

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Loosen the Setting screw of the upper forming plates. Remove the Screw and remove the Shim under the Hinge. Check that there are two Shim under the Bracket as default (about 3.4mm).
    2. Raise the upper forming plate halves (can be locked in raised position with the aid of an Allen key through the hole in one of the Locking block support and above the erector Frame).
    3. Put the Template in the forming plates.
    4. Make sure that the upper forming plate presses against the Template and measure the required shim thickness between the Hinge and the upper forming plate. Choose a shim 0.1mm thinner than the measured value. Put the shims under the Hinge and tighten the Screw.
    5. Check once more against the Template.
    6. Repeat the setting procedure for the other upper forming plate.

    7. Adjust the Setting screw so that they press against the erector Frame. If any further minor adjustment is required in the Z-direction at the front end, adjust with the Setting screw.
    8. The upper forming plates must press lightly against the templates in both ends. It should be easy to move the templates backward and forward using just a little force.
    9. Measure the distance in the front end (in Y-direction) between the Template and the upper forming plates. Divide the distance by using the Setting screw so that the templates centre in the forming plates.
    10. Remove the dummies and put the internal tools back on the mandrels.
    11. Set the pusher, see Procedure Pusher - Set Overtravel, where applicable.

    1. Check for cracks or wear in the Contact surface. If required, change the Pusher piston and check the overtravel of the pusher, see Procedure Pusher - Set Overtravel on page Pusher - Set Overtravel.
    2. Check the Pusher piston surfaces for even wear. If one of the ends shows signs of excessive wear, make sure the pusher pistons are set correctly, see Procedure Erector - Basic Set on page Erector - Basic Set. The forming plates have to be aligned with the mandrels. See Procedure Pusher - Align on page Pusher - Align. The Linear guide have to be in line with the forming plates. **Note:** If the previous instructions do not permit the Pusher piston to rest evenly and firmly in the forming plate, continue with the following.
    3. Check the Pusher rod and make sure that they are straight. This can be done by using a ruler or preferably on a diabase table. **Note:** Valid for Micro: it is also very important that the Pusher piston support is straight and in line with the Pusher rod.

A (mm) = 0 -0/+0.4

    5. Mount the Pusher rod complete with the Pusher piston and the Spring on the Linear sliding unit using the screws but leaving out the Front end shim and the Back end shim. Measure the distance **B** between the Pusher piston in its front end and in its back end. The distance in the front end should be equal to or max. 0.2 mm, less than the distance in the back end. If this is not the case, the Pusher rod needs to be bent in the front end to achieve the correct distances described above.
    6. Remove the screws and put the Front end shim and the Back end shim equal to the distance measured between the Pusher piston and the forming plate. Add approximately 0.2 mm to the shims in the Front end shim against the forming plate.

This operation can be executed in two different ways. Before a resetting is
done, perform a quick check to check if the resetting is necessary.

#### Quick Check

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Inch the machine until the outer carriages have gone back from overtravel (adjustment **MSP 200-514** ). (The overtravel is about 4mm).
    2. Step the machine down to step zero.
    3. Check the distances **D** and **C**. See the table below. Check also that the distance **C** is equal at both ends of the forming plate. If the distances are incorrect, loosen the Screw and set the distances. If necessary, set according to Method A (Using a Template) or Method B (Without Template).Distance | Base| Midi| Mini| Micro  
---|---|---|---|---  
C (mm)| 74.0 ±0.5| 58.0 ±0.5| 48.5 ±0.5| 37.0 ±0.5

    6. Check and adjust the vertical position of the Erector finger in the template grooves. Place the shims if necessary: The Shim 1 for outer carriages and the Shim 2 for inner carriages.
    7. Move the carriages relative the Rack so that the Erector finger reaches bottom of the template grooves.
    8. Tighten the Screw between the racks and the lugs. Check the position of the erector fingers and the indirectly driven carriages (strokes of the carriages are to be 200mm and 26mm, respectively).

    10. Run the machine and check that the Lid splice, from tools on the lid, lines up with the Packaging material crease. If deviation, remove the same thickness of the Shim 1 as the deviation, from one erector finger, and add the same thickness, under the other erector finger (Example: 0.5mm deviation = remove 0.5mm shims from one erector finger and add 0.5mm under the other). Run the machine and check again. **Note:** When changing the shims under the erector fingers, make sure that they never crash downwards or upwards into the forming plates. **Note:** Make sure that the Bracket does not collide with the Forming plate. There must be a clearance between the Bracket and the Forming plate, see arrow in illustration.

### Functional Description

The cooling water system consists of three circuits: ice water from the
customer cooling system, the internal cooling system and a separate internal
cooling system for the **LFU**. It is important to follow the specifications
in the **IM** to make the system function properly.[//]: # (Start of section
about Ice Water from the Customer Cooling System)

### Ice Water from the Customer Cooling System

Ice water is transported directly to the oil cooler in the Hydraulic unit O202
and the cooler in the Electrical cabinet O207. Ice water is also transported
in the primary circuit in the Heat exchanger O203 and the Heat exchanger O212,
in the two internal systems.The ice water used in the filling system is
divided in two lines between S1 and S2. Each line has two units. In one unit,
**HEPA** air cools the peroxide reducer, the tank breathing and the cleaning
boxes. The other unit is in series with the first unit. It is an air cooler
with **HEPA** air for the hygiene chamber.[//]: # (The image below is used to

The cooling water flow is regulated by the flow meterA30P4331 to the flow
meterA72Q2212.The temperature is primarily regulated by an adjustable
temperature regulating valve. The temperature regulating valve is sensitive to
the temperature sensorA24B0202 of the outflow, on the secondary side of the
heat exchanger. It regulates the flow of ice water on the primary side,
depending on the measured temperature. It is of critical importance to keep
the cooling water temperature constant for the internal and external tools.
The temperature regulating valve has a pneumatically controlled on/off valve,
pneumatic valveA24K0256/A66K0211, which is normally opened.[//]: # (Start of

The Temperature regulator, regulates the temperature for the cooling water. To
ensure that cooling water temperature not drops too much, the Valve actuator
(F200), is built to shut down the cooling water outlet.The Valve actuator
(F200) is normally open.The Valve actuator (F200) closes (= air pressure On),
after that the temperature has dropped 1 °C from pre-set value.The temperature
of the regulator is set to one degree Celsius higher than on the **TPOP** to
make the regulator precede the value of the **TPOP**.[//]: # (The image below

### Functional Description

The power generating part of the unit consists of a 7.5 kW Electrical motor
and a variable displacement Pump. The maximum continuous flow is 26 l/min at
1450 r/min. The displacement is controlled by the consumption of oil so that
the flow at every moment is just enough to maintain the set pressure. The
maximum pressure is set to 160 bar and a sealed overflow valve is set to 210
bar and has a maximum flow of 28 l/minute. The pump is connected to a 70 litre
stainless steel Tank. The tank contains of a Level glass, an analogue
Temperature gauge, and a level sensor with two alarm levels. The first starts
an audible alarm, the second stops the machine.[//]: # (The image below is
used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

# (The list below explains the different parts of the illustration.)

  1. Temperature gauge
  2. Level glass
  3. Tank
  4. Electrical motor
  5. Pump

As the maximum instantaneous flow consumption is considerably higher than 26
l/minute there is an Accumulator on the pressure side. When the instantaneous
flow is higher than 26 l/minute the accumulator supports the flow. When the
instantaneous flow is lower than 26 l/minute the accumulator is recharged
until it reaches full pressure. The accumulator, which is a bladder type, has
a volume of 10 litres and is pre-loaded on the gas side to 120 bar.The
hydraulic power unit contains another flow circuit for filtration and cooling.
This consists of a 15 l/minute pump powered by a 0.18 kW Electrical motor. The
filtration and cooling circuit is on continuously as long as the hydraulic
power unit is on. The flow passes through a Heat exchanger where the cooling
agent is dairy ice water. A temperature sensor in the circuit, before the heat
exchanger, controls (on or off) the ice water flow. After the heat exchanger
there is a Filter including a filter guard. The guard activates an alarm if
the filter is clogged and needs to be replaced.This extra pump circuit can
also be used to fill up and to empty the tank with hydraulic oil. A special
hose is included for this.The hydraulic power unit contains the pump and tank
unit for the Central lubrication.[//]: # (The image below is used to

When a safety door is opened while the hydraulic pump is running, the
hydraulic pressure must rapidly drop to zero. This safety function is
monitored by pressure switch A24B0204.

#### Fault-finding

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. During operation: Alarm and indication on the **TPOP**.
      * No signal is received from pressure switch A24B0204.
      * Action: Replace the pressure switch.
    2. Fault after stopping the machine: Alarm and indication on the **TPOP**.
      * The pressure must drop below 1.5 MPa within 3 seconds of stopping. 
      * A signal is still being received from pressure switch A24B0204.
      * Action: Check the door safety switch.

#### Checking

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Open one of the safety doors and check on the pressure gauge that the pressure drops rapidly to zero. A slight knock must be heard from the accumulator after roughly one second when the membrane hits the end section.
    2. If the hydraulic pressure is low with the safety door closed:
      * Trace for possible electrical faults.
      * Check the hydraulic pump.

#### Oil requirement

To avoid unnecessary and unplanned stops in the hydraulic system, it is
important to always maintain a high oil quality. Tetra Pak suggests in this
instruction a way to handle this.It is not always enough to change the oil
within a specified period. Tetra Pak also recommends a test of the oil even if
it has been recently changed. This is to make it possible to find faults as
overheating and water impairing before it causes a breakdown. See instructions
below.The oil must be tested due to particle contamination and water
impairing. The oil must correspond to (or be better):

  1. ISO 4406:1999, 19/16/13 or SAE AS 4059 (similar to older NAS 1638), class 7.
  2. Water impairing must be maximum 200 ppm (= 0.02%).
  3. If there is a larger amount of water in the oil, it is possible to detect it by the methods described in Check of oil quality. However the oil can contain up to 600 ppm (0.06%) water without it being noticeable for the eye. The only way to detect this is with an laboratory test.

#### Oil Test

To get an oil test performed, contact for example HYDAC (www.hydac.com) and
order equipment to take the oil sample.Tetra Pak suggests the oil analyse PVM-
MVA-WA 1279078, which provides you with the following analyses:1/ Microscope
impurity analyse2/ Water content (K. Fisher) Coulomat3/ Particle countingWhen
an oil sample is taken and sent to HYDAC, the “Oil Sampling Record “on the
next page must be completed. The record is also delivered with the oil sample
equipment.As a test an oil sample was sent to HYDAC by Tetra Pak.[//]: # (The
image below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above
in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000145078.png)

The answer from HYDAC is shown below.Denomination| Figure| Allowed value |

---|---|---|---|---  
Microscope impurity analyse | 1| See it as an information| \- - - -| \- - - -  
Water content | 2| Not more than 200 ppm (0,02%)| 299.25 ppm| = Not OK

#### Oil Check

Check: Drain some oil every six months and perform a check according to the
flowchart below. About how to drain, see the following pages. For every other
check (= once a year) send an oil sample for analyse. **Note:** If the oil
turns out to be impaired, follow the instructions in , to find the fault and
repair it.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the
procedure (explained above in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000364162.svg)

#### Check of Oil Quality

Type of Check| Analyse Description| Action  
---|---|---  
Oil Status| Check the oil visually and compare the smell of the old oil with
new oil of the same type and brand. If the old oil looks and smells like the
new oil it is usually in good condition. | 1/ If the oil smells or looks bad,
change oil. See Procedure Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil.2/ Run the machine for a
month. Send thereafter an oil sample for analyse.  
Overheated Oil| Overheated oil is dark (= brown) and smells burnt (= bad
smell).| 1/ Try to find out why the hydraulic oil has been overheated, and
make action to protect from further overheating.2/ Change oil. See Procedure
Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil.  
Water or Air Impairing in Oil| If the oil is “cloudy” (= white), it indicates
that the oil contains a lot of water or air.Water DetectionTo find out if
there is water in the oil use one (or both) of these methods:1/ Perform a
“crackle test”: Pour a sample of the oil in a large spoon. Heat the spoon from
the underside (by a cigarette lighter). If there is water in the oil it will
start boiling and crackles.2/ Take an oil sample in a glass and let “rest” for
a while. If there is water in the bottom, it is obvious what caused the
impairing.Air DetectionIf there is no water according to items above,
“whiteness” is due to air. Another sign for air in the oil is a not properly
working system. With to much air mixed in, the oil system will “swing” and
probably cause an odd behaviour in the LFU. There can also be cavitation noise
(slam from the pump).|  **Whiteness due to water:** Try to find out why the
oil is impaired with water. Some causes are listed below:- A faulty heat
exchanger.- Water has pierced into the tank during cleaning.- Condense.The
**oil must be changed** to protect the system from unnecessary wear and
corrosion. Do as follows:1/ Let the hydraulic unit “rest” for a while.
Evacuate the water by draining the oil tank until oil comes out. See Procedure
Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil.2/ Run the hydraulic unit.3/ Change oil. See
Procedure Hydraulic Unit - Change Oil. **Whiteness due to air:** \- Low oil
level in tank - Fill it up.- Air leakage somewhere in the hydraulic system.
Probably in the suction pipe for the hydraulic pump - Try to trace and repair.  
  
#### How to Drain for an Oil Sample

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Connect the Sampling valve to the Test point: A30K1229 (S1) or A30K2229 (S2).
    2. Start up the hydraulic unit on low pressure. See Procedure LFU Remote Control - Handle.
    3. Drain out approximately 0.5litres of oil, before filling up the bottle for the oil sample. **Note:** It is very important to drain at least 0.5litres. This is to clean the Sampling valve from foreign particles.
    4. Remove the Sampling valve from the Test point.

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Connect the hexagonal Check-valve housing to the nitrogen bottle. In some markets an Adaptor is used for connecting the nitrogen bottle. This adaptor is included in the pre-loading equipment kit and is manufactured especially for the market in question.
    2. Remove the Sealing cap and the Valve cap from the accumulator gas valve. For the **TT/3** accumulator, with 5/8”-18 **UNF** thread the Adaptor must be used (included in the pre-loading equipment kit). Assemble the adaptor onto the Gas valve before continuing. Assemble the Swivel connector onto the adaptor. Hand-tighten sufficiently to prevent gas leakage.
    3. Turn the Handle bar to the right, opening the gas valve core in the accumulator.
    4. Open the valve on the nitrogen bottle slowly to allow the expanding bladder to close the Oil valve.
    5. Charge to 12.0 MPa (120 bar). **Note:** The pressure will drop slightly when the compressed gas cools down. Therefore, pre-charge to 15 - 20% above the desired pressure.

## Central Lubrication

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The central lubrication system uses a piston pump driven with compressed air.
In order to operate correctly the system must be free from air. The lubricant
is fed from the central lubrication pump through the main line, distribution
blocks and to the dosing valves in the dosing blocks. From here the lubricant
is independently dosed with a set quantity, to each lubrication point in the
system. The pump keeps the lubricant under pressure for a short while during
each lubrication cycle. The system is then decompressed to a pressure of
approximately 2-5 bar. The residual pressure is important since a too high
pressure does not give any refilling of the dosing valves and if there is no
residual pressure, air might enter the system.The lubrication cycle runs every
15 minutes. The first 40 seconds of the cycle the pump is pressurising the
system. By 38-40 seconds of the lubrication cycle the pressure in the system
is checked by means of the pressure switch in the front of the machine. From
the 51 second to the end of the lubrication cycle it is checked that the
pressure switch is not activated. Thus it is verified that the pressure switch
is working and is not short circuted.The system can also be activated from the
TPOP to run an intense lubrication cycle e.g. when bleeding the system. See
Procedure Central Lubrication - Force Lubrication through TPOP.[//]: # (Start

The pressure during the lubrication pulses must be 5-6 MPa (50-60 bar). The
pressure is shown by the Pressure gauge. The residual pressure between pulses
must be 0.2-0.5 MPa (2-5 bar).The Pressure switch is located in the machine
front.In case of alarm for low lubrication pressure, check the system for
leakage.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the

To ensure a good lubrication through the central lubrication system, it is
important that the system is free of air.To ensure a good function the system
must be bled:

    * after a break off of the lubrication system
    * after change and/or overhaul of a unit
To eliminate air in the supply hoses, loosen a venting plug or the supply hose
at the connection blocks according to illustrations below.

### Functional Description

The package disinfection process in the TT/3 filling machine is based on
vaporised hydrogen peroxide and UV-light. The hydrogen peroxide vapour
condensates and forms a thin layer on the inside of the packaging material,
and it has a strong germicidal effect when illuminated by the UV-lamp. When
handling hydrogen peroxide take care to read the Section Hydrogen Peroxide in
the Chapter ii Safety Precaution.The hydrogen peroxide system in the filling
machine variant **XH** sprays vaporised hydrogen peroxide on the inside of the
package just as it enters the hygiene chamber. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
used in the filling machine variant **XH** is diluted to a concentration of
3%.The hydrogen peroxide system in the filling machine variants **AD** ,
**ADY** , **ASD** , **ASCM** , and **AW** sprays vaporised hydrogen peroxide
on the packaging material web before it is cut in to blanks. This is a pre-
treatment of the inside of the packaging material. The sleeve is then formed
and provided with a lid. The inside of the package is sprayed again just as it
enters the hygiene chamber. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) used in the filling
machine variants **AD** , **ADY** , **ASD** , **ASCM** , and **AW** is diluted
to a concentration of 3%.

  * One tank (valid for **XH** ) or two tanks (valid for **AD** , **ASD** , **ASCM** and **AW** ).
  * Two pumps (valid for **XH** ) or four pumps (valid for **AD** , **ASD** , **ASCM** and **AW** ). Two pumps for pre-treatment (valid for **AD** , **ADY** , **ASD** , **ASCM** , and **AW** ) and two for package disinfection.
  * One panel used for monitoring the flow to the pre-treatment evaporator (valid for **AD** , **ADY** , **SD** , **ASCM** , and Water). One panel used for monitoring the flow to the package disinfection evaporator.
  * One pre-treatment evaporator and pressure switches (valid for **AD** , **ADY** , **ASD** , **ASCM** , and **AW** ), and one package disinfection evaporator and pressure switches.

The tubing from the Quick-connection is divided into two, one for Side 1 and
one for Side 2. Each side has an electrically driven peristaltic Pump. The
rotation speed is controlled by an analogue signal of 0 to 4 VDC. The rotation
speed of the pumps, and thus the hydrogen peroxide flows, are set by the
operator from the **TPOP**. When installing a new pump or changing the tubing,
the spring tension of the Spring loaded tension arm has to be set. This is
done by turning a Setting screw. Adjusting the spring loaded tension arm to
set the peroxide flow is not recommended. The hydrogen peroxide is pumped to
the Spray body at the evaporator.[//]: # (The image below is used to

The hydrogen peroxide flow and the air flow can be visually monitored on the
Panel. It includes Filter and four flow meters. The hydrogen peroxide Flow
meter, H2O2 are used for visually monitoring the H2O2 flows. The Flow meter,
air are used for visually monitoring and adjusting the air flows. The panel
includes an adjustable Regulator that regulates the system air pressure. From
the panel the air is divided and distributed to the Spray body on Side 1 and
Side 2.If the Heater is heated up without the air flow it will brake. The air
comes from the Valve which is normally open. If there is a power failure or
the coil to the valve has broken, the air will still flow through the spray
bodies and heaters to protect them from damage.[//]: # (The image below is

At the Peroxide unit the peroxide and air flow is monitored by the Pressure
switch, H2O2 and the Pressure switch, air. The Spray body has a built in
needle that can be used to clear the nozzle if it has become clogged.Peroxide
and air is atomised in the spray body and the mixture is then vaporised in the
Heater. The temperature in the heater is controlled by a Thermocouple.
Monitoring and adjusting of the temperature levels is done by the operator
from the **TPOP**.The vaporised hydrogen peroxide air in the unit for pre-
treatment is lead through the hose and out the peroxide spray nozzles in the
Pre-treatment box. The vaporised hydrogen peroxide air in the unit for package
disinfection is lead through pipe into the hygiene chamber and out through the
peroxide Spray nozzle into the packages. The flow of hydrogen peroxide air
mixture is constant.The spray unit contains a check valve to protect from
uncontrolled drainage of hydrogen peroxide while the air is flowing through
the spray body and the nozzles. The check valve is not adjustable.[//]: # (The

### Functional Description

A Servomotor drives the cam module for cutting and folding, and the curve
unit. The motor is equipped with a brake to prevent unintentional movement by
hand. The brake also prevents movement if energy is built up in the system
when the servomotor power is cut after the doors are opened, for instance
spring force from the pusher or from mechanical parts after a crash.The
machine can not be cranked by hand. All movements must be made by the control
panel.The control of the servomotors is synchronised with the rest of the
machine by the **PLC** system.The servomotor drives a Planetary gear (PV10)
4:1, which drives a Worm gear (SV5) 7.25:1. The reason for the two gear
solution is that if all of the gear ratio were done by the worm gear, it would
become self-locking. If there is too prompt a stop of the servomotor, the
self-locking could damage the worm gear. Another reason is that a higher gear
change results in a lower efficiency with more heat released as a
consequence.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the
procedure (explained above in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000145212.png)[//]:
# (The list below explains the different parts of the illustration.)

  1. Servomotor
  2. Planetary gear (PV10)
  3. Worm gear (SV5)

In the rear section of the machine, the Worm gear (SV5) drives a Bevel gear
(VV9) with gear ratio 1:1. On the two Output shaft, there is one cam for
cutting functions and one for folding functions.Ahead in the machine the worm
gear drives a Bevel gear (VV7) with gear ratio 1:1. It has only one Output
shaft which drives the curve unit, also called record player or jukebox.
Between the worm gear and the Bevel gear (VV7) there is an Overload clutch
that releases at 400 Nm. The normal torque is 220-250 Nm during PRODUCTION.
The overload clutch can only be engaged in one position and with that the
synchronization is maintained. A proximity switch senses when the clutch has
released and stops the machine.The Worm gear (SV5), and the Bevel gear (VV7)
and the Bevel gear (VV9) have sensors for the oil levels. During operation so
is the oil not checked because of the risk for false alarms due to that the
oil is tossed around in the gears.The oil level is checked one minute after
every operation, if the oil level is low a blue alarm will occur. The blue
alarm turns to a yellow alarm after one more hour of operation and then it is
not possible to continue operation without filling oil.The Planetary gear
(PV10) is filled with grease.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate

#### General

When work is to be done on drive unit in carton section, a good advice is to
secure with the zero setting rods before the system is disassembled. Otherwise
there is a risk that settings are disturbed and a new calibration has to be
done.

#### Coupling Between VV9 and SV5 - Assemble

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Insert the Zeroing rod (977709) in the Zero setting hole for the Cam module cut and fold.
    2. To get the correct synchronisation position against the SV5, insert the zeroing rod into the Cam module erector, see Couplings Between VV7 and SV5 - Assemble. **Note:** Make sure that there is no grease on the shafts for VV9, SV5 and on contact surfaces for the Coupling.
    3. Distribute the Coupling so it has equal connection into both shafts, VV9 respectively SV5, tighten the screws with 250 Nm.
    4. If necessary calibrate the Servomotor, see Procedure Drive Unit - Homing on page Drive Unit - Homing.

The sprue remover unit is placed on the conveyor and removes the sprue from
the top of the packages before the cap is assembled. A belt brake is used to
transport the package in the conveyor direction and support the package
through the sprue remover unit.With a Belt and a Wheel, the sprue remover unit
pulls the sprue perpendicular to the movement direction of the package. The
sprue is pulled off, transported to the drop chute, and gathered in the
collection box at the outfeed side of the sprue remover unit.For a description
of other types of Sprue removers, see Functional Description.[//]: # (The

### Functional Description

The Lid Forming Unit ( **LFU** ) forms and fits a lid with an opening device
at the top of the Tetra Top package. In the following pages, a short
description is given of the path of the plastic through the **LFU**. **The
Colour Feed and the Transfer Unit** In the Colour feed, the Coloured granulate
is fed into the Transparent PE granulate by a Cylinder. Depending on the lid
design the programme controls the frequency for the valve. [//]: # (The image

The quantity of plastic in the Accumulator is controlled by the speed of the
Screw. The screw rotates continuously at high speed or at low speed. When the
accumulator is empty, the screw moves at high speed. When the accumulator is
half full with plastic, the screw moves at lower speed. The screw stops when
the accumulator is full The transfer unit only operates when the machine is in
running position. [//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in
the procedure (explained above in text))

  2. Screw

 **Hot Channel Unit** The plastic is transferred from the accumulator to the
Injection cylinder through a heated Hose.There is a Non-return valve in the
hot channel unit. When the injection cylinder is off, the plastic pressure
returns to the cylinder piston. The stroke length of the injection cylinder
can be adjusted by a Stop screw. The amount of plastic, called the dose,
depends on the stroke length. The needle valve is kept closed by a Spring in a
Pneumatic cylinder. When the injection starts the pneumatic is shut off and
due to the plastic pressure the non-return valve is closed and the Needle is
opened by the plastic pressure. [//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate

 **Identification of Hot Channel Piston Versions** The main difference between
the Hot Channel Pistons is the cooling body attached to the Pistons in version
With Cooling. The different versions are illustrated in this Section.[//]: #

Channel Piston Version With Cooling

 **Piston unit (Valid for Hot Channel Version with Cooling)** To reduce the
plastic leakage, a unit with a Cylinder and a Piston is made with a specific
gap, in the combination with a Cooling body results in a controlled plastic
leakage. It’s possible to change the piston unit without changing the entire
Hot Channel.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the
procedure (explained above in text))

  2. Needle

 **Cooling circuit for Hot Channel Piston (Valid for Hot Channel Piston
Version with Cooling)** The cooling circuits purpose is to cool the plastic
between the piston and the cylinder in order to not leak as liquid plastic.
This is done with a water Cooling body on the cylinder and in a parallel a
glycol circuit with a separate Flow meter. During stand still there is a pulse
function that switches the water valve on and off to prevent plastic to freeze
around the pistons.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in
the procedure (explained above in text))

  1. Flow meter

 **Movement of the External Tools** A servomotor and a hydraulic cylinder with
two areas determine the movement of the external tools. The small area on the
hydraulic cylinder is for the movement when the cylinder works together with
the accumulator. The accumulator empties when the tools close and charges when
the tools are open e.g. brake action. [//]: # (The image below is used to

illustration shows the big area

 **Accumulator** The accumulator is a diaphragm membrane accumulator with an
air connection on the non- hydraulic side. The air pressure is controlled by a
regulator and a non-return valve. When the air pressure is below the set
pressure, i.e., when the air volume is as big as possible, air is filled up
through the regulator and the non-return valve. To avoid building up an over
pressure on the accumulator’s oil side, the accumulator is bled through a
small restrictor and a non-return valve. To make sure that there is correct
pressure on the oil side, the accumulator is recharged once every cycle. This
is done when the oil volume is maximum and is controlled by a directional
valve. The recharging is done through a non-return valve and a pressure
regulator. [//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the
procedure (explained above in text))

 **Lock** During the closing of the tools, the pneumatically controlled Lock
activates. The lock closes when it passes the Recess on the Horizontal force
shaft. The sensor gives a signal and the hydraulically controlled Horizontal
force cylinder activates to keep the halves of the external tools together.

 **Distance Cylinder** The distance cylinder keeps the external tools and the
hot channels apart at the opening and closing of the tools. **Tightness** The
big area of the vertical force cylinder activates at low pressure, about 9
bar, to tighten between the hot channel and the tools.[//]: # (The image below

 **Injection** The injection cylinders activate and inject plastic into the
cavity. There are sensors for full and empty cylinder. **Pressing** When the
injection cylinder is empty the sensors activate pressing e.g. the big area
and high pressure on the vertical cylinder. The pressure is controlled by a
proportional valve.The plastic cools down and pressing is done. Tightness
releases and the horizontal force cylinder releases. The lock opens and the
external tools open. **Reference Cylinders** The reference cylinders open the
cavity at the injection. The reference cylinders are activated when the first
lids are produced at start up. During a safety stop the length of the cylinder
can be set when the cylinder is in deactivated position.[//]: # (Start of

[//]: # (Start of section about Alarm 110303661/110303662 “Hydraulic
Accumulator Wrong Pressure”)

### Alarm 110303661/110303662 “Hydraulic Accumulator Wrong Pressure”

 **Description** The hydraulic accumulator supports the servomotor in the tool
movement. The air pressure in the accumulator is recharged over a non-return
valve by pneumatic air to 2.8-3.0bar and then by hydraulic oil, recharged to
13bar. The accumulator air pressure varies during the cycle due to the volume
change of oil in the accumulator, open or closed tools. In the cycle, when
tools are opened, the recharge valve opens for a short time to obtain the
pressure balance between the pneumatic air and the hydraulic oil in the
accumulator. This is to compensate the bleeding. Bleeding is always on to
avoid overfilling of oil due to the position change of the logic element. To
detect a hydraulic overload by oil volume, the hydraulic pressure is
supervised by the Pressure switch. With the tools closed, the accumulator unit
is almost empty of oil. The hydraulic pressure is then normally 2-3bar.
**Conditions to Set the Alarm** The alarm will be set if there is a higher
hydraulic pressure than 8bar in the accumulation unit during pressing at the
sector value 500-1000. The normal value is 2 bar to 3bar.When this alarm
appears, the machine performs an Empty Package Stop and steps down to
Heating.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the

## PE drop at LS inside of a Tetra Top package

[//]: # (Start of section about Important information about the PE drop at the
LS)

## Important information about the PE drop at the LS

[//]: # (Start of section about Background)

### Background

The PE drop at LS (plastic flash) that can be seen inside the package is a
natural part of the Tetra Top package design. The drop is caused by tolerances
and safety precautions that are set so that the packaging material is not
punctured when double material gets squeezed between the outer and inner
tools.The input for the safety margins (LS compensation in tool) is:

  * The tolerance of the material web reel
  * The sleeve tolerance when sealing
  * The sleeve rotation when putting the sleeve into position for lid forming

The tools are designed to compensate for all the tolerances and ensure that
the packaging material is not punctured.Due to the fact that LS overlap will
vary from reel to reel the LS clearance for the tool has to be large enough
for the largest LS without puncturing the sleeve. The PE drop is caused when
the LS width on the sleeve is smaller than the LS clearance. [//]: # (Start of
section about Size of the PE drop)

### Size of the PE drop

Because of the huge variety of the different top designs and sizes it is
impossible to say what size and appearance the PE drop must have. As long as
the machine can strip the package from the mandrels the PE drop is small
enough. The PE drop is needed to produce safe packages with maintained package
integrity. As long as the packages pass the destructive and blue ink package
integrity checks according to OM – Package Check, the PE drop is large
enough.[//]: # (Start of section about Factors that influence the PE drop
size)

### Factors that influence the PE drop size

[//]: # (Start of section about Lid Thickness)

### Lid Thickness

The lid thickness depends on the plastic dosing and pressing pressure.
Increasing the plastic dosing without changing the pressing pressure will
result in a thicker lid. Decreasing the plastic dosing without changing the
pressing pressure it will result in a thinner lid.The plastic dosing together
with the pressing pressure also affects the shape and size of the PE drop.By
increasing or decreasing the plastic dosing and at the same time increasing or
decreasing the pressing pressure the shape and size of the PE drop and the lid
thickness will change. **Note:** Going outside of the specified limits of lid
thickness will create problems with integrity, capping, heat and
stability.[//]: # (Start of section about Package material)

### Package material

The width of the reel can differ from reel to reel, while staying within the
tolerance of the packaging material. This makes the LS overlap slightly larger
or smaller. A smaller LS overlap creates a bigger PE drop.[//]: # (Start of
section about Pressing pressure on LFU)

### Pressing pressure on LFU

The pressing pressure is used to press the plastic into the moulding tool
cavity. A higher pressing pressure can make the PE drop larger, and a lower
pressure can make it smaller. The values in the MM are default values and can
be adjusted in order to optimise the performance. Approximately a ±10% change
can be used if all other settings are OK and the package functionality is OK.
**Note:** The pressing pressure will directly affect the lid thickness. A
smaller pressing pressure will make the lid thicker but also increase the risk
of the plastic does not cover the sleeve completely or holes in the lid.[//]:
# (Start of section about Sleeve top circumference)

### Sleeve top circumference

The sleeve top circumference affects the LS overlap which then affects the
plastic flash. A smaller sleeve top circumference causes a bigger LS overlap
and a smaller PE drop. **Note:** An incorrect sleeve size will seriously
affect the package integrity and performance of the machine. [//]: # (Start of
section about Mechanical setting of LFU and tools)

### Mechanical setting of LFU and tools

Incorrect mechanical settings can influence the PE drop in both directions.
LFU and tools must be set according to the MM.[//]: # (Start of section about
Position of the PE drop)

## Position of the PE drop

[//]: # (Start of section about Factors that influence the PE drop position)

## Factors that influence the PE drop position

[//]: # (Start of section about Crease position)

### Crease position

The crease position set by the operator directly affects the position of the
PE drop. If the crease is moved to the left in the ASU the PE drop will move
to the left side of the LS as seen from the inside of the package.[//]: # (The
image below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above
in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000861549.png)

 **Note:** The positioning of the crease is something the operator check and
change often due to the factory creasing position on the package material.
There is only one setting for this and that is in the centre of the K crease
in the bottom of the package. If this is out of position it will affect the
bottom and flap sealing of the package.[//]: # (Start of section about Sleeve
rotation on the mandrel)

### Sleeve rotation on the mandrel

The sleeve rotation on the mandrel will affect the position of the PE drop.
There is only one setting for this and that is that the crease on the sleeve
must be aligned with the centre of the outer moulding tools. **Note:** If the
sleeve position on the mandrel is incorrect, a basic setting of the erector
unit is needed.[//]: # (Start of section about LFU)

#### Positioning

In the front of and the side of the frame (see arrows in illustration) there
are engraved figures. The figures come from a check of the frame against the
drawing specification.A deviation from the nominal measure at each measuring
point, results in an engraved figure in the frame. If the measuring spot is on
the nominal value, the engraving is **0**. **When to use** To set the vertical
guide to a correct position, the bars must be set to the nominal value against
the measuring surfaces. The value that is measured must be compensated with
the marked deviation when setting the vertical guide. The engraved marking is
the deviation from ±0 and is a factory set value. [//]: # (The image below is
used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0004296192.png)

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Measure the distances **A, B, C,** and **D** with a Deep gauge.Engraved values on the frame can be specified in two different ways, for example: -16 or -0.16: Both values mean -0.16 mm.Negative engraved values mean the surface on the frame is below nominal value. Positive engraved values mean the surface on the frame is above nominal value.
    2. Compensation: Measured setting value should be compensated with the engraved value.
      *  **Example no. 1:** Engraved -0.16 must be added as 0.16 to the measured value.
      *  **Example no. 2:** Engraved 0.10 must reduce the measured value by 0.10.

If the run-out tolerance is more than the recommended it can affect the
bearing installation and the sealings in the Connection with a water leakage
as a result. Therefore it is advisable to aim for a run-out as low as
possible.If the run-out tolerance is more than recommended, do as follows:

    1. Increase the torque on one or more of the Screw, meanwhile check the measuring instrument if the run-out tolerance is affected.Nominal torque is **22 Nm** , not more than **25 Nm** is recommended.
    2. If this does not work, loosen all the Screw and tighten them with different torque until the run-out tolerance is as low as possible.This technique can lead to a torque for one or more of the Screw to be beneath **22 Nm** , secure those Screw with **Loctite 243**.

### Description

The extruder motor runs at two different speeds determined by the level of
plastic in the plastic accumulator. The level is supervised by the Inductive
sensor (upper) and the Inductive sensor (lower).When the **LFU** is running
continuously the extruder motor is supposed to run mainly in low speed mode,
occasionally changing to high speed mode (every second or third
injection).Problems with the extruder motor will be indicated by a common
alarm, displayed as “`F/C FEEDER MOTOR OVERLOAD`” on the **TPOP** panel. This
alarm can be the result of mechanical and/or electrical overload, as well as
if the extruder motor has been running continuously at high speed for more
than 30 seconds. The latter is to indicate a blocked or limited granulate flow
into the extruder or a leakage of plastic after the extruder.If the "low"
speed of the extruder is set too high, the extruder will not switch to "high"
speed as intended. Then there is a risk that the alarm "`F/C FEEDER MOTOR
OVERLOAD`" will not be set if a heated hose breaks.[//]: # (The image below is

  1. Plastic accumulator
  2. Inductive sensor (upper)
  3. Inductive sensor (lower)

If the Plastic accumulator hits the mechanical stop when it is filled, and the
extruder does not stop in time, a high pressure peak can be created in the
heated hose. The pictures below show the three different stages of the Plastic
accumulator function. **(A)** The Plastic accumulator is full. The Inductive
sensor (upper) and Inductive sensor (lower) are both activated and stops the
extruder motor. No plastic is fed to the plastic accumulator. **(B)** One
Inductive sensor (upper) (the upper sensor), is activated and sets the low
speed to the extruder motor. Plastic is continuously fed to the plastic
accumulator. **(C)** The Plastic accumulator is empty. None of the sensors are
activated. This sets high speed to the extruder motor. Plastic is fed up to
the Plastic accumulator. [//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the

      1. Plastic accumulator
      2. Inductive sensor (upper)
      3. Inductive sensor (lower)

#### Set low speed

Fine adjustments must be performed for every individual unit. See section
Settings on page Settings for basic setting values.When the frequency for low
speed is set correctly, the extruder motor works mainly in low speed mode and
occasionally change to high speed mode (not to stop). The ideal setting is if
the motor works continuously at low speed without interruptions.

    * Step the machine up to production.
    * Make sure that the two sensors are not activated. If they are, the extruder works with an over capacity and regulates between low speed and stop, which causes unnecessary high stress on the motor and gearbox.
    * If necessary, decrease the frequency for low speed.

#### Set high speed

The frequency for high speed mode must be approximately 20% higher than the
low speed frequency. The setting of the high speed is most critical the first
time, after the machine has been stepped down to out of heating.

    * Step the machine up to production.
    * Observe the accumulator and the sensors during the first ten **LFU** cycles. If the accumulator at any time reaches the upper mechanical stop (the plastic accumulator is empty), the frequency for high speed must be increased.
    * If necessary, increase the frequency for high speed.

Checking the lid thickness and opening force gives a good indication of the
condition of the lid forming unit ( **LFU** ).If the opening values are within
limits according to specified values in the **OM-PC** , no further setting is
necessary.The lid thickness gives a good picture of the condition of the tools
knife edge.

    * Thick, tight lids with a low opening force indicate good condition.
    * Thin lids with a high opening force indicate bad condition or settings. See LFU - Troubleshooting.

### Overview CAU

The Screw Cap Application Unit (CAU) contains a Machine Body, a Pneumatic
Panel, Transfer Unit, Screw Cap Handling, Screw Cap Applicator unit, Doors and
Covers, and Duct.It also includes a Screw Cap Supply Unit (CSU) and a Vision
Unit, that is located external from the main machine.[//]: # (The image below

[//]: # (Start of section about Duct and Sprue Box)

### Duct and Sprue Box

When the lid is manufactured with inlet moulding, there is a leftover called
Sprue. The Sprue is separated from the lid with the Knife.The Sprue falls
through the Duct, down to the Sprue box. The Sprue box can be reached by
opening the Hatch.The Hatch can be opened during PRODUCTION in order to empty
the Sprue box. The Sprue box needs to be emptied every third production
hour.When 11 000 packages have been produced according to the count on the
**TPOP** , a blue alarm occurs. Empty the Sprue box and reset the blue alarm.
If this is not done a yellow alarm will occur on the **TPOP** when the
photocell for the Sprue box is activated. When the blue alarm has been active
for 3 seconds the machine will step down to tankfilling on the affected
machine side.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the

[//]: # (Start of section about Transfer Unit)

### Transfer Unit

The packages are transferred into the Magazine, by the **LFU** -stripper. The
packages will then be rotated one revolution in the Magazine. This is done to
cool down the lid before fitting the screw cap.After one revolution the CAU
stripper will move the packages into the Capping station. The CAU stripper is
driven by the Drive unit.If there are packages in the capping station in this
moment, they will be moved to the Cassette in the package section by the
**CAU** stripper in the same stroke. **Note:** It is possible to open the
upper forming pipes in the Capping station, to remove packages. See further
instruction in the Operator Manual.[//]: # (The image below is used to
illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

[//]: # (Start of section about Screw Cap Applicator Unit)

### Screw Cap Applicator Unit

The screw cap is assembled when the package is positioned in the Capping
station. It is the Screw Cap applicator unit that applies the screw cap to the
package.While the CAU stripper moves packages and places new packages in the
Capping station, the Screw Cap applicator unit moves down and away (forward)
from the Capping station to pick up new screw caps from the screw cap handling
unit (the screw cap handling unit will be described later).Then the Screw Cap
applicator unit moves up and toward (backward) the capping station, to
position the screw caps in front of the packages in the Capping station.
Finally the Screw Cap applicator unit starts to rotate the screw caps and the
**CAU** stripper moves the packages toward the screw cap to assemble them.
When the screw caps have been assembled, the cycle start over again.[//]: #

[//]: # (Start of section about Screw Cap Handling)

### Screw Cap Handling

The screw caps are blown up from the **CSU** to the Cyclone. From the Cyclone,
the screw caps fall down into the Screw cap sorter. The Screw cap sorter turns
all screw caps with the same side down to align them, then the Screw cap
sorter distributes the screw caps down the Chute.The screw caps are
transported down the Chute. Further down the chute they are divided between
two chutes to supply both sides of the Screw cap transfer.[//]: # (The image
below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in
text))

  4. Screw cap transfer

The Loading piston transfers the screw cap through the Tube into the Screw Cap
Holder in the screw cap applicator unit. The Screw Cap Holder rotates the
Screw cap to match the heels in the screw cap with the heels on the loading
piston and registers the screw cap position. The loading piston moves back and
the screw cap applicator unit lifts the screw cap and assembles it to the
package as described earlier.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate
the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

### CSU

The CSU feeds one TT/3 with screw caps. There are two sides in the **CSU** ,
**S1** and **S2** (see illustration). Each side contains a Container, and a
Fan. One side of the **CSU** serves one production side on the **CAU** with
screw caps.The Electrical cabinet serves both sides of the CSU.One Container
has the capacity to hold 15 000 screw caps. A full Container can be emptied in
two minutes, using the emptying function.[//]: # (The image below is used to
illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

# (The list below explains the different parts of the illustration.)

  1. CSU
  2. Container

  3. Fan
  4. Electrical cabinet

The screw caps are stored in the Container. From the Container they fall down
on the Conveyer. The Vibrator shakes the container to keep the screw caps from
becoming jammed at the bottom of the Container.The Conveyer transports the
screw caps until they fall down into the **HEPA** -filtered air stream that is
driven by the Fan. Then the screw caps are blown through the Outlet, and
through the pipe that leads to the screw cap sorter on top of the screw cap
applicator unit in the TT/3.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the
steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

  4. Fan
  5. Outlet

To perform certain maintenance procedures or to change screw cap colour, it is
necessary to empty the **CSU** from screw caps. An emptying function is built
in for this purpose. The Hatch must be folded out according to the
illustration. When the Push button is pushed, the Conveyer will reverse. Then
the screw caps will be transported out through the Hatch. For further
instructions about the emptying procedure, see the Operation Manual ( **OM**
).When the level of screw caps is low in the **CSU** , a blue alarm occurs.
When the **CAU** is emptied, the blue alarm will remain.[//]: # (The image

### Vision Unit

The vision unit ejects packages when the screw cap is not properly attached.
It is a pneumatic cylinder that ejects packages. There is also a cylinder for
volume change with two different positions depending on package height. The
camera takes care of the fine adjustment automatically. For example, BASE 750
and BASE 1000 uses the same position of the volume change cylinder which the
camera can handle, while for example BASE 500 and BASE 1000 use different
positions for the volume change cylinder.[//]: # (The image below is used to

 **Conditions to set the alarm** This alarm is a summary alarm and can be
caused by a numerous of reasons, mechanically and electronically. The
electronically reasons are the same for every servo axis in the machine. The
alarms that are likely to be mechanically connected are the following.

  * `Position error fault`
  * `Motor overtemp fault`

`Position error fault` is set due to that something suddenly is disturbing the
motion of the mechanics. This could be some kind of obstacle (a loose bolt
etc), lack of lubrication, a stuck ball bearing.`Motor overtemp fault` is
similar to the above fault but here the disturbance is not that sudden. If the
motor for some reason is forced to work harder it will become hot and the
`Motor overtemp fault` will occur. The cause could be slowly degrading
lubrication, wear of bearings and guides, or basically that the environment
(i.e. cooling capacity) around the motor has changed. **Troubleshooting**

  * Look for any obvious obstacles in the magazines movement. Try to rotate the mechanics manually to check that it moves smoothly.
  * Check that the motor, the gearbox and the rest of the mechanics are properly fixed (loose bolts etc).
  * Check that the electrical connections are properly connected, both to the motor and to the servo drive in the electrical cabinet. Also inspect the cables to make sure that they are not damaged.

#### Introduction

In the case of sporadic machine issues spread out over time, package waste
figures for cap torque and tilted cap can be high even though the machine is
not stopped for a specific alarm.The reason being that the software is
configured to only stop the machine if the same failure mode happens several
times in a row or during a short period of time.This trouble shooting guide is
for that reason using the waste as origin instead of an alarm from TPOP.[//]:
# (Start of section about Troubleshoot - Quick Guide)

### Troubleshoot - Quick Guide

[//]: # (Start of section about Troubleshoot - Cap Torque Error Waste)

### Troubleshoot - Cap Torque Error Waste

 **Cap Torque Error, High Waste** To guarantee that the cap is properly
attached to the neck, the capping sequence has a quality control.The cap is
applied with a set torque and how many degrees the cap turns is measured.If
the cap turns more than allowed it indicates an incorrect capping, the package
will then not be filled and wasted in front of the machine.The torque error
can come from that a cap is not in place to be capped, so analysing the waste
is the first step in finding the root cause of the problem. **Flow charts

### CSU Air Speed - Check

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

According to the Maintenance Manual, the airspeed must not exceed 10 m/s.
However, the best solution is for the airspeed to be as slow as possible. See
Procedure Feed Unit - Set Fan Speed .

    1. If you do not have an airspeed measuring device, slow down the fan 1 Hz at a time. Run the machine for 10 to 15 minutes.
    2. Repeat this step until the **CSU** fails to supply the machine with caps. Then empty the system of caps, increase the speed by 2 Hz, and then restart production. This is the best **CSU** airspeed for this equipment.

[//]: # (Start of section about How to Understand Cap-Related Waste)

### How to Understand Cap-Related Waste

There are two types of cap-related waste:

  * camera waste
  *  **FM** waste

For camera waste, it is important to differentiate ghost waste from tilted
caps:

  * Ghost waste occurs due to a faulty camera setting.
  * Tilted caps occur due to heat problems in the top, or misalignment in the **CAU**.

For **FM** waste, see Section How to Understand Cap Waste in FM.[//]: # (Start
of section about How to Understand Cap Waste in FM)

### How to Understand Cap Waste in FM

Broken caps on the sprue box cause wasted packages without caps. Broken caps
are caps that have been smashed in the cap loading area. The caps are smashed
because they have been in the wrong position (not all the way down or fallen)
during the cap loading sequence.Reasons for broken caps:

  * The 69-mm setting of the cap loading position is not set correctly. See Procedure Cap Loading Piston, Template, Setting - Check.

  * The ends of the cap chutes are bent. See Procedure Cap Chute Quality - Check.

  * The cap hatches or cap chutes are not set correctly causing lack of cue pressure, which makes the caps fall in the cap loading position. See Procedure Cap Chute Hatch Setting - Check.

  * The Y-setting is wrong causing lack of caps and cue pressure. See Procedure Direction Guide, Air Nozzle - Check.

  * Wrong type of cap chute lids. See Procedure Cap Chute Lids - Check.

  * The springs are broken.

  * Wrong type of bushings. See Procedure Bushing - Check.

[//]: # (Start of section about FAQ)

### FAQ

  * Why are there many plastic particles everywhere?
    1. The **CSU** speed is set too high. See Procedure CSU Air Speed - Check.
    2. Make sure you have the correct air flow. See Procedure CSU Air Speed - Check.

  * Why do the caps get stuck in the cap trap in the sorter?
    1. The wrong part is used or the settings are wrong. See Procedure Cap Trap Lid, Guide, Air, Nozzle - Check.

  * Why do the caps get stuck in the chutes?
    1. The tamper rings are damaged in the pipes from the **CSU**. See Procedure CSU Air Speed - Check.
    2. The wrong lids are being used. See Procedure Cap Chute Lids - Check.
    3. The lids are not mounted correctly. See Procedure Cap Chute Lids - Check.

  * Why do the caps get stuck in the ”Y”?
    1. Check ”Y” settings according to Procedure Direction Guide, Air Nozzle - Check.
    2. Make sure that the chutes and hatches are okay. See Procedure Cap Chute Lids - Check, Procedure Cap Chute Hatch Setting - Check, and Procedure Cap Chute Quality - Check.

  * Why are there problems with damaged caps in the cap loading area (smashed caps, broken tamper rings, and so on)?
    1. Make sure that the cap loading is correct. See Procedure Cap Loading Piston, Template, Setting - Check.

  * Why do the caps get stuck in the cap loading area?
    1. The settings are wrong or the wrong parts are used. See Procedure Bushing - Check, Procedure Cap Loading Piston, Template, Setting - Check, and Procedure Cap Chute Quality - Check.

  * Why is the cap sorter too slow?
    1. The cap sorter could be too slow because the wrong settings can have been chosen on the **TPOP**.

  * Why are the lids too warm?
    1. The **HC** temperature sensor could be out of position. See Procedure HC Output and Temperature Sensors - Check.

  * Why do caps get stuck in the cap trap right after the sorter?
    1. The edges in the cap trap are sharp.

This operation is done to ensure a correct overloading of the loading pistons.
Too little overloading makes the screw caps fall out of the screw cap holders,
too much overloading breaks the capping cylinder.

    1. Before performing this setting, make sure that the cap lift is in cap transfer position. See Procedure Screw Cap Lift - Set End Positions.
    2. Activate the capping cylinder valves to push the screw cap holders in loading position. To activate the valves, see Procedure Pneumatic Valves - Manual Override.

    6. Rotate the screw cap holders to the left, gently by hand, until the heels in the screw caps are aligned with the notches on the Loading piston. **Note:** This step is performed to ensure that the over travel distance will be correct. If the notches on the loading piston and the heels in the screw caps are interfering in the wrong way, the over travel distance will be incorrect.
    7. Use a feelergauge to check the distance **A** between the Loading piston and the Bracket.
    8. To set the distance **A** , loosen the Lock nut and adjust the position of the Bracket with the Adjustment screw and tighten the Lock nut.

### Functional Description

 **Introduction** The unfinished packages enter the package section from the
mandrel wheels and are placed in cassettes. These cassettes transport the
package through the filling and bottom sealing mechanisms. The packages are
then placed on an outfeed unit and exit the machine. **Note:** Read the
description in the specific sections for more information. **Conveyor and
Conveyor Drive Unit** The conveyor is made up by a number off cassettes, the
unit that drives them and various equipment that guides the cassettes.The
cassette conveyor is driven by two servo motors attached to two planetary
gearboxes. The front and back wheels are driven by separate servomotors. The
front wheel is automatically adjusted by a homing procedure. The mechanical
play is by default set to 70% between the upper cassettes and 30% between the
lower cassettes. The mechanical play of the front wheel can be adjusted on the
TPOP. The start position of the rear wheel (the infeed wheel) is adjusted on
the TPOP. The drive unit is also synchronized with the other movements in the
machine through the PLC system. **Bottom Sealing** The Bottom sealer has two
servo driven units. The first of these is the lifting unit that lifts the
cassette with the filled package, the cassette stabilizer and the volume
displacement cylinders. The second unit is the sealing unit with a knee
mechanism that moves the sonotrodes and the dolly and assures the sealing by a
pneumatic spring force. **Final Folder** The function of the final folder unit
is to fold the transversal seal, form it to flaps and seal them to the bottom
of the package to make the package stand steadily. **Outfeed Unit** The
function of the discharger unit is to pull the packages from the cassettes and
place them on the conveyor chain. Packages with unsealed flaps are detected by
a photocell (in the machine body) and ejected. **Hygiene Chamber** The hygiene
chamber prevents contamination from the surrounding environment. This is done
in three steps:

  * Spray of H2O2 peroxide solution.
  * High energy UV-radiation.
  * Removing peroxide residue using hot HEPA-filtrated air.

### Safety Air Valve - Description

#### General

The following table describes the functions performed by the Safety air
valve.Machine status| Phase| Function performed by the Safety air valve|
Comment  
---|---|---|---  
Air on| 1| The pneumatic system is exhausted of all air.|  
2| The pneumatic system is pressurised to 50% of the incoming pressure| If the
air pressure is impeded by leakage in the system, the Safety air valve will
not continue to phase 3  
3| The pneumatic system is pressurised to 100% of the incoming pressure|  
air off| Exhaust| The pneumatic system is quickly exhausted of all air| This
function is also performed if an emergency stop is actuated, or if a door is
opened  
The Manual open/close valve is normally in the open position.[//]: # (The

### Folding

During the dwell time of the cassette conveyer, the folding and sealing take
place. A synchronized movement of the lifter and knee mechanism makes the
folding. This combined movement follows a predicted Folding curve.[//]: # (The

### Sealing Functionality

The US-horn are clamped with a Mechanical joint to Pneumatic spring carriage
and Pneumatic spring carriage which can move independently from each other. On
these pneumatic spring carriages there are four Pneumatic membrane that are
always pressurized with the setting from a Regulator. The membranes are
pressing against the Overtravel carriage.[//]: # (The image below is used to
illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

  3. Pneumatic spring carriage
  4. Pneumatic spring carriage

  5. Pneumatic membrane
  6. Regulator

  7. Overtravel carriage

The three carriages move together as a group. When the knee mechanism is
moving down, the force is almost infinite when the Link reaches its nearly
straight position. At this point the mechanism reaches an end point due to
that the distance between the anvil and **US** -horns is zero. This is basic
setting for the end point of the servomotor.When the folded package is
squeezed between the Anvil and the US-horn there will be a distance D of 0.4
mm compressed paperboard. The Overtravel carriage moves then into the
Pneumatic membrane leaving a distance E of 0.35 mm in-between the Pneumatic
spring carriage and Pneumatic spring carriage and the Overtravel carriage. The
force in the system is now set to the pneumatic pressure in the membranes and
the sealing pulse can be performed.[//]: # (The image below is used to

Equipment Status| Air must be turn ON.  
  
---|---  
[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. To decrease sealing pressure, turn the hand wheel counter-clockwise. **Note:** When decreasing pressure, it is necessary to turn approximately 0.4 bar below the estimated value, and then up again to the value.
    2. To increase sealing pressure, turn the hand wheel clockwise.
    3. Basic setting: choose the same pressure reading for both Pressure regulators one pressure regulator for each subside of the machine).
    4. At production, fine tune each side after checking the sealing quality. **Note:** During manufacturing and assembling of converters and sonotrodes, there is always a difference in the amplitude movement of the unit. This means that the air pressure regulators for the sealing pressure may have to be set individually between the subunit to create the same energy so that a good sealing can be produced. The energy values can be shown on the TPOP monitoring window.

The signal goes low when the pressure is below 0.3 bar.

  1. Set the Pressure regulator so that the Pressure sensor shows 0.6 bar.
  2. If the Pressure sensor shows less than 0.3 bar, check for leakage, and check the particle filter. See Filters - Check.
  3. If necessary, the pressure regulator can be adjusted up to max 0.7 bar to get a higher pressure on the system. this can be done if there is a small leakage or a clogged filter.

with the UV-lamp.

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The **UV** -lamp system consists of two **UV** -lamp units and their cooling
system (one on each side of machine side).The combination of peroxide and
**UV** -radiation effectively disinfects the surface of the packaging
material.In order to reduce heat, the **UV** -lamp is cooled by a Venting fan,
which sucks air through the Lamp housing. [//]: # (The image below is used to
illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

# (The list below explains the different parts of the illustration.)

  1. Venting fan

  2. Temperature sensor

  3. Lamp housing

The cooling capacity (speed of venting fan) is controlled by the Temperature
sensor and a frequency converter. The optimal cooling air temperature is 55
°C. (The cooling temperature is permanently preset. It is not necessary to
check or adjust it.) **Illumination of the hygiene chamber by UV light:** The
**UV** light has an additional function Illumination by UV light, which can be
used to illuminate the hygiene chamber for approximately 10 minutes. The
**UV** lamp will be extinguished (goes immediately out) under alarm conditions
or upon opening of a door.To prevent overheating of the package cassettes, the
lamp will only work during the program steps MOTOR RUNNING, PRODUCTION, END
PRODUCTION, and when the machine is performing a VOLUME CHANGE.[//]: # (The

## Drive Unit

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The Cassette Conveyor is driven by a Servomotor, through a Planetary gear
(gear ratio 80:1) and two bevel gear boxes (Bevel gearbox VV1 and Bevel
gearbox VV2 (gear ratio 2:1)). It is synchronised with the other movements in
the machine through the **PLC** system.The system cannot be cranked by hand.
It must be driven using the inch button on the panel.Oil level sensors are
built in to the bevel gearboxes VV1 and VV2. If an oil level is low, an alarm
on the panel signals. The alarm only signals if the machine has been out of
operation for more than one hour. During operation, the oil is tossed around
in the gears, which could result in false alarms. The planetary gear (2) is
filled with grease.All four drive shafts are equipped with a Safety clutch
that releases at 250Nm. A Proximity switch senses when the clutch releases and
stops the machine.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in

## Conveyor, Cassette Lubrication

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The Cassette Lubrication is intended both for rinsing after a crash and for
lubrication during production. During rinsing after a crash, minor product
residues on the cassettes are flushed off. During production, the cassette
links are lubricated with water.Drinking water, with no chemicals added is
used, and a UV-lamp is sterilizing the water beforehand, for both machine
sides. The system is automatically rinsed with Oxonia through the Valve during
each disinfection phase.

  * Flushing to remove product residue after a stop is done by the Spraying nozzle. This function must be started on the **TPOP**. The Pressure reducing valve must be set according to Lubrication Water - Check. **Note:** The cassettes must be empty before flushing is possible.

  * Dripping water from the Pipes lubricates the cassette links during production.
  * The Flow control valve and Flow control valve must be set according to Lubrication Water - Check.

If the alarm `73331 UV water cleaning lamp low intensity` occurs, the UV-lamp
and sensor must be checked and, if necessary, cleaned according to Cassette
Lubrication - Clean UV-lamp and Sensor. If the problem is not resolved, check
the UV-lamp assembly. Make sure that no water has reached the electrical

## Gas Dosing System (Optional Equipment)

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

 **Valid for Festo and Mecman** Not all machines have the gas dosing
system.Some products are affected by oxygen in the head-space of the package.
Vitamins, colour, and taste can be affected. If the oxygen level is reduced,
from the normal 21% to about 8 to 10%, the shelf life of the product can be
increased considerably. The gas dosing system does that by replacing the
oxygen with a substitute gas.

  * Gas at 4 to 6bar passes from the supply unit through a connection at the filling platform to a Valve block in the front of the machine. The valves switch between substitute gas and compressed air.
  * A Proportional valve reduces the gas dosing pressure to the value that is set in the **PLC** -program. This is about 2.5bar during production.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0001630908.png)

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0001630907.png)

  1. Valve block
  2. Proportional valve

  * The gas enters a filter unit that consists of a 5 micron filter and a 0.01 micron filter.
  * The gas is then distributed to the two stations through Fixed restriction and 0.2micron Absolute filter that filter the gas once again.

[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure
(explained above in text))

# (The list below explains the different parts of the illustration.)

  1. 5 micron filter
  2. 0.01 micron filter
  3. Fixed restriction
  4. Absolute filter

Two stations are fitted over the packages as follows:Station 1| Located before
the product filling.  
---|---  
Station 2| Located between the filling pipes and the bottom sealing.  
  
  * When the gas dosing system is functioning but not in production there is a constant flow of compressed air through it. The airflow stops bacteria from entering the gas dosing system when the gas is turned off. This also reduces the gas consumption.
  * As soon as a sleeve is fed from the cutting device into the conveyor (at production start), the valves switch from air to gas with a pulsed flow through the Pulse valve.

  2. Station 2
  3. Pulse valve

When the **TTCU** starts to clean the hygiene chamber the Valve, Valve and
Drain Valve close and the Cleaning Solution Valve and the Valve opens. The
Valve and Valve create a buffer that ensures that no build up of liquid
reaches the Absolute filter. The valves stay in this configuration for all the
**TTCU** cycles until the disinfection starts. In the disinfection cycle, the
Valve opens and the area between the Valve and Valve is disinfected. After the
hygiene chamber clean is complete the Cleaning Solution Valve closes and the
Drain Valve opens to drain the remaining liquid and remains open during
production. At this time the Valve and Valve opens and the Pulse valve starts
to pulsate. Compressed air is then pushed through the system to push out any
remaining fluids.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in

### Functional Description

 **Introduction** The filling section has two main tasks:

  * to provide the right amount of filling product to the packages in the hygiene chamber.
  * to perform and support hygiene functions of the filling machine (with the exception of external cleaning in the hygiene chamber cleaning and package disinfection).

The filling section is also the main supply distributor for granulate,
drinking water, ice water, air, and gas (gas is only valid if the machine is
equipped with the gas dosing system).For a functional description of the
filling system, see page Filling System.For a functional description of the
hygiene functions, see page Hygiene Functions.[//]: # (Start of section about
Filling System)

### Filling System

 **Note:** Distance filling is used on a ADY variant machine. Bottom up
filling is used on a standard variant machine. **Note:** It is only possible
to produce sweetened condensed milk on both production sides at the same
time.The two production sides of the machine can produce two different
products at the same time. Two separate 50 litre tanks for the filling
product(s) enable the machine to fill two different products simultaneously
and independently.The product enters the tank via a Valve. The valve keeps the
product level in the tank relatively constant. Information about the current
level is communicated from the Level probe via a signal from the PLC to the
control unit in the Valve.Two filling pipes lead the product from the tank to
the packages. A servo-assisted piston pump measure and portion the filling
product from the package's open bottom end. For a functional description of
the piston pump see Pump Units.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate
the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

### Hygiene Functions

The following list is a brief overview of the **TT/3** filling machine hygiene
functions:

  * Cleaning of the filling system, **CIP**. See page Cleaning of the Filling System (Cleaning In Place, CIP).
  * Sterilisation of the filling system, **SIP**. See page Sterilisation of the Filling System (Sterilisation In Place, SIP).
  * Quick Rinse, **QR** (Optional for **XH** ). See page Quick Rinse of the Filling System (QR Optional).
  * Cleaning and disinfection of the hygiene chamber. See page Cleaning and Disinfection of the Hygiene Chamber.

The machine program is configurated to perform cleaning in place,
sterilisation in place, quick rinse, cleaning, and disinfection when started
by the operator from the **TPOP**.

  * Clean air system, filtered HEPA. See page Clean Air System.

  * Pre-treatment of the packaging material web, H202 (valid for **AD** , **ADY** , **SD** , **ASCM** , and Water). See Section Peroxide Unit on page Peroxide Unit.
  * Package disinfection, UV+H2O2. See Section Peroxide Unit on page Peroxide Unit.

For machine variant **XH** , the operator must activate, from the **TPOP** ,
the hydrogen peroxide system to run the machine with hydrogen peroxide.For
machine variants **AD** , **ADY** , **SD** , **ASCM** , and Water, the machine
is automatically run with hydrogen peroxide.For machines variants **XH** ,
**3A** and **XHIC** , a short automatic purge is performed every four hours
during production.[//]: # (Start of section about Cleaning of the Filling
System (Cleaning In Place, CIP))

### Cleaning of the Filling System (Cleaning In Place, CIP)

The **CIP** cleans the filling system by using the diary cleaning supplies
systems or by using a separate unit called **ALCIP**. The purpose of the
**CIP** is to ensure that there are no residual product in the filling system
nor in their connections. The program is performed in many steps. See the flow
charts and sequence diagram for more information on the **CIP** steps. The
flow charts and the sequence diagram are laminated documents. The sequence
diagrams can also be seen in Chapter General. For more information see also
the **OM**.[//]: # (Start of section about Sterilisation of the Filling System
(Sterilisation In Place, SIP))

### Sterilisation of the Filling System (Sterilisation In Place, SIP)

The purpose of the **SIP** is to reduce the number of bacteria in the filling
system. This is done by the **SIP** and must be preceded by a complete
**CIP**.

  * Heating 
  * Steam sterilisation 122°C, 20 minutes
  * Cooling
  * Pressure balance. The purpose of the last step is to balance the pressure and cool the pipes in order to make production start possible.

See the flow charts and sequence diagram for more information on the **SIP**
steps. The flow charts and the sequence diagram are laminated documents. The
sequence diagrams can also be seen in Chapter General. For more information
see also the **OM**.[//]: # (Start of section about Quick Rinse of the Filling
System (QR Optional))

### Quick Rinse of the Filling System (QR Optional)

The purpose of the **QR** is to rinse out product left in the filling system
at the time for product change.The **QR** option differ from product to
product and must be evaluated and defined. The result of a **QR** is a product
contact surfaces that are visually clean. The principle of the **QR** program
is to open up paths of the product contact surfaces in the filling system. 2
to 3 paths are used and repeated a number of times.It is site responsibility
to evaluate an define how many times the water rinse sequences should be
repeated. The total time needed for a **QR** is the time that the water (at
specified quality) must be supplied to the **TT/3** .[//]: # (Start of section
about Cleaning and Disinfection of the Hygiene Chamber)

### Cleaning and Disinfection of the Hygiene Chamber

The purpose of the cleaning and disinfection is to remove residual product and
to reduce the number of bacteria in the area where the packages are filled and
sealed.This is performed by a separate unit, the Tetra Top Cleaning Unit
**(TTCU)**. For more information on the **TTCU** see Chapter Tetra Top
Cleaning Unit. See also the **OM**.[//]: # (Start of section about Clean Air
System)

### Clean Air System

High Efficiency Particulate Air ( **HEPA** ) flows from cabinets and units to
the:  
---  
•| Hygiene chamber. The **HEPA** cabinet for the Package Section ( **PS** )
provides the hygiene chamber with a defined flow of filtered **HEPA**. Here,
the purpose of HEPA is to prevent contamination from the surrounding
environment during the filling and sealing processes. The filtered **HEPA**
enters the hygiene chamber where the packages enter chamber and above the
bottom sealing.  
•| Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reducer. The H2O2 reducer has outlets above the
cassettes in the hygiene chamber as hot filtered HEPA is used for removing the
H2O2 residue in the packages before filling.  
•| Tank breathing and cleaning boxes. The filtered **HEPA** from the **HEPA**
cabinet for the Filling Section ( **FS** ) prevents the surrounding air from
entering the product tanks during filling. The excess air from the tanks is
directed to the cleaning boxes where it is distributed around the filling
pipes.  
•|  **Valid for:** Hygiene level UHHLid Forming Unit ( **LFU** ). The **HEPA**
cabinet for **LFU** provides a defined flow of filtered **HEPA** over the
**LFU**. Here, the purpose of HEPA is to prevent contamination from the
surrounding environment. The **HEPA** filter is in the filter housing above
the **LFU**.  
•|  **Valid for:** Hygiene level UHH **Valid for:** Equipment with CAUCap
Application Unit ( **CAU** ). The **HEPA** cabinet for **CAU** provides a
defined flow of filtered HEPA over the **CAU** to prevent contamination from
the surrounding environment. The **HEPA** filter is in the filter housing
above the **CAU**.

### Functional Description

 **Angle seat valve** The main parts of the angle seat valve are shown in the
illustration below.The following instructions cover both **NC** (Normally
Closed) and **NO** (Normally Open) valves.[//]: # (The image below is used to
illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

 **No Product In Hepa (NPIH) system** It is very important that product never
reaches the **HEPA** filters in the machine for any reason. If this happens
the hygiene in the machine will be lost. To prevent this from happening, a
system consisting of an Air sensor, Pressure gauge, Product Relief Valve
(PRV), High pipe and Non-return valve has been implemented on the machine.The
first part of the system works by detecting air and high pressure in the
product and consists of the Air sensor and the Pressure gauge. The second part
is the relief part and works by closing the Product valve and opening the PRV
when air or high pressure is detected. The system ensures that any product
containing air or too high pressure is drained out without reaching the
Product tank. During production, two scenarios can set a high product pressure
yellow alarm. 1) The product pressure is higher than 200 kPa for more than 10
seconds.2) The pressure peaks at above 200 kPa for more than 2 seconds 10
times.If the alarm occurs the machine empties out all packages and steps down
to program step Preheating.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the
steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

  1. Air sensor
  2. Pressure gauge
  3.  **PRV**
  4. High pipe

  5. Non-return valve
  6. Product valve
  7. Product tank

During **CIP** a yellow alarm occurs if the pressure is above 4 kPa for more
than 2 seconds.If the Air sensor detects air during program step production,
the PRV immediately opens and a blue alarm occurs. If air is detected for more
than 10 seconds, the Product valve closes and the air in product yellow alarm
occurs. **Note:** The pressure release function is disabled for ADY.During the
program steps Tankfilling and Motor on the air in product yellow alarm is set
immediately if the Air sensor detects air. **Note:** The pressure release
function is disabled for ADY.The **PRV** can also be opened manually in
certain program steps to purge unwanted product from the machine. See the
**OM** for more information.As an added backup the HEPA air pipe into the
Product tank also includes a Non-return valve. This Non-return valve stops any
splash in the product tank so that it does not reach the HEPA air system.
Splashing can be caused by bubbles that enter the Product tank. The non-return
valve also stops product from reaching the HEPA air system through overfilling
of the Product tank if the level probe fails for any reason.[//]: # (The image

#### Initialization

During initialization the positioner adapts itself optimally to the friction
conditions and the signal pressure required by the control valve.

Risk of injury due to the actuator stem extending or retracting.Do not touch
or block the actuator stem.

The process is disturbed by the movement of the actuator stem.Do not
initialize the positioner while the process is running and only after
isolating the plant by closing the shut-off valves.

The type and extent of self-adaptation depends on the preset parameters. MAX
applies as the default setting for the nominal range (Code **P4** ). During
the initialization process, the positioner determines the total travel range
or rotational range of the valve (from the CLOSED position to the opposite end
position).Alternatively, a different travel can be selected in Code **P4**
(see code list in Setting other valid parameters. **Note:** The travel set in
Code **P4** is only limited during initialization. However, it might be
exceeded in closed-loop control when the control signal is higher than 20
mA.[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

Start initialization

    1. Enable configuration according to Procedure Enabling configuration to change parameters.
    2. Touch DOWN button or UP button until Code **P15** appears.
    3. Press CONFIRM button and hold for six seconds. 6...5...4...3...2...1 is counted down on the display.
The initialization starts and INIT blinks. The time required for the
initialization procedure depends on the actuator transit time and can take a
few minutes.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the

      1. Manual mode

    4. Touch DOWN button or UP button to change the manual set point.
 **Initialized positioner** The manual mode starts using the last set point
used in closed-loop operation, ensuring a bumpless changeover.The bar elements
on the display indicate the system deviation between the manual set point and
set point used for closed-loop control while manually moving the valve in Code
P17.The manual set point is adjusted in steps of 0.1%. You can move the valve
controlled within its range. **Positioner that has not been initialized**
Touch DOWN button or UP button for a long time to move the valve manually.The
valve is only moved in one direction uncontrolled. The bar elements on the
display indicate the change in direction.Touch CONFIRM button to deactivate
manual mode. **Note:** The Manual mode function can only be exited as
described or by interrupting the electrical supply (cold start). The
positioner does not automatically exit this function and return to the display
showing the status indication.

#### Fault

In case of a fault, the Fault indication icon is displayed. Switch past Code
P0 or P20 to display the respective error code E0 to E15 together with ERR
appear on the display. Refer to the Error codes list on page Error codes for
the cause of the errors and the recommended action. **Example:** If, for
instance, a travel has been entered in Code P4 (nominal range) which is larger
than the maximum valve travel possible, the initialization process would be
interrupted (E2 error code) because the rated travel would not have been
reached (E6 error code). The valve moves to the Fail-safe position
active.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the

### Functional Description

The Fill pump is driven by a Servo motor. The Universal Product Valves Inlet
UPV and UPV, and the Resuction device are pneumatically activated, and the
timing is coordinated from the servo to ensure correct speed and accurate
filling.The servo motor drives the fill pump. The servo motor contains a motor
combined with a roller screw. This results in a reliable high-speed filling
system. Each time that the machine steps up to program step Air on, a homing
procedure is performed on the servo motors. The servo motor is oil cooled and
lubricated in order to keep correct working temperature.Before production, air
is purged from the system and a column of product stands ready for filling.
This is activated on the **TPOP**. Both the Inlet UPV and the UPV are closed
at the start of production.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the

Fill stroke:

  * Resuction is deactivated just after the start of filling.
  * As the UPV opens, the piston moves forward to push product out of the Pump chamber.
  * The outlet **UPV** closes at the end of the fill stroke, and the resuction device is activated just before the fill stroke ends.

Charge stroke:

  * The Inlet UPV opens and the piston moves backward to charge the Pump chamber.
  * At the end of the charge stroke, the inlet **UPV** closes.

The process repeats itself throughout production.The Leakage detector detects
any leakage behind the diaphragm in the Fill pump. The Leakage detector
detects leakages in the Resuction device. The detectors are connected to
different alarms on the **TPOP**.[//]: # (The image below is used to

work on the filling system.

Burn hazard.Pipes and components in the filling system can be hot. Allow the
pipes and components to cool down before starting any work on them. If this is
not possible, use caution when working near the hot pipes and components.

#### Preparations of the Piston Pump

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Disassemble the piston pump, follow the sub procedure 
      * Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms (see Procedure Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms).or
      * Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms and Seals (see Procedure Piston Pump - Change Diaphragms and Seals).
    2. Risk of damage to the equipment.The piston surface can easily be damaged, which can lead to premature failure of the diaphragms. Never use a vice to hold the piston unit.

Remove the six Screw, the Connection plate and the Rear diaphragm from the
Piston.

    3. Remove the Nut, the Washer, the Plate, and Front diaphragm.
    4. Reassemble a Piston unit with a Connection plate, six Screw and a Piston. **Note:** The procedure is valid for variant Base, Midi, and Mini. The procedure for variant Micro is similar to that procedure and therefore not described.

#### Check Piston Centring in Pump Cylinder

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Check the Piston position in the Pump cylinder. Use the Adjustment pin to detect if there is any deviation in the piston centring. The adjustment pin must without any difficulty be able to run in the gap **A,** around the **** piston in the pump cylinder. If the gap **A** is not according to the table below the feeler pin will get jammed and the piston needs to be repositioned. **Note:** The large end of the adjustment pin is to be used for variant Base, Midi, and Mini. The small end of the adjustment pin is to be used for variant Micro.
    2. If there is a deviation in the centring of the Piston adjust the alignment of the Servomotor and Motor cradle by turning the screws, see Procedure Piston Pump - Set Piston Centring.

Remaining fluids and steam.The filling system could contain fluids and steam
under pressure. Release any pressure and drain any fluids before starting any
work on the filling system.

Burn hazard.Pipes and components in the filling system can be hot. Allow the
pipes and components to cool down before starting any work on them. If this is
not possible, use caution when working near the hot pipes and components.

 **Note:** The installation of new diaphragms require the filling system to be
cleaned and sterilised before production can start again. This can be done
with the other side in production, if the process equipment is connected to
the machine with separate product lines. Perform CIP and SIP before starting
production on the serviced side.

    1. If one side is still in production, step that side down to tank filling.
    2. Risk of damage to the equipment.The vacuum system creates vacuum for the piston pumps on both Side 1 and Side 2 in all program steps. If the vacuum system is interrupted in **production** or **end production** , the piston pump diaphragms can be damaged. Make sure that the machine is in **tank filling** (or in a lower program step) on both Side 1 and Side 2, before removing the vacuum hoses from the piston pumps.

Disconnect the vacuum Hose from the pump to be serviced, at the Leakage
detector. Use a Hose-hose connection and a Blanking plug to plug the Hose.

    3. Check that the gauge on the vacuum pump reads **-0.7 to -0.8 bar**.
    4. If it is desirable to run production on the side where the service work is not performed, step that machine side up to production.

[//]: # (Start of section about Vacuum System Functional Description)

### Vacuum System Functional Description

The purpose of the vacuum system is to make sure that the diaphragms are
always in contact with the piston pumps. This ensures that the diaphragms do
not fold or break prematurely. Compressed air enters the system through the
Connection and is regulated with the Valve. The vacuum is continuously
measured by the Pressure guard and the Valve opens when the vacuum is above
-60 kPa (-0.6 bar) and it remains open for 10 seconds to build up the vacuum
again. If the vacuum is above the allowed value for more than 30 seconds the
blue alarm occurs. If the vacuum rises above -50 kPa (-0.5 bar) the yellow
alarm occurs. The vacuum itself is generated in the Ejector as the compressed
air passes through it and out the Hose. The passing air sucks out the air in
the rest of the system and creates the vacuum. The vacuum is preserved with
the Non-return valve.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps
in the procedure (explained above in text))

  3. Pressure guard
  4. Ejector
  5. Hose
  6. Non-return valve

There is one vacuum cabinet for each side of the machine. The system is then
divided at the T-connection and supplies both piston pumps for that side of
the machine. The Non-return valve and Non-return valve ensures that if one

### Functional Description

 **Note:** The ice water cooling of the product tank is disconnected for the
machine variant AW.The ice water that flows through the TT/3 ice water system
is supplied by the customer's external ice water system. The TT/3 must be
supplied with a flow of 85l/min and the ice water must have a temperature of 1
to 7˚C (33.8 to 44.6 °F). The flow and temperature are both measured and
logged by the TT/3.The ice water circulates through the **HEPA** cabinets and
the cooling mantle of the product tank before it returns to the customer's
external ice water system. The **HEPA** cabinets must be continually cooled
with ice water to ensure a high hygienic level. The mantle of the product tank
is only filled from program step tank filling to program step production end.
During these program steps, the cooling effect keeps the product in the tank
cool.When a **CIP** or **SIP** is performed on the TT/3, the ice water shall
not be on in the mantle. If the ice water is on, the rapid heating during
these procedures can cause problems with expanding steam and water. To avoid
these problems, the ice water is pumped out from the mantle and returned to
the customer's external ice water system. By pumping the ice water back to the
external ice water system, there is also no waste.When the ice water is
removed from the mantle of the product tank, it is first collected in the
Water tank. When the water tank is full, the Pump starts up and returns the
ice water to the external ice water system. When the level in the Water tank
is low, the pump stops again.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate

### Trouble shooting 110305711/110305712

 **Description** When the ice water is removed from the mantle of the product
tank it is first collected in the Water tank. When the water tank is full the
Pump starts up and return the ice water to the external ice water system. When
the level in the Water tank is low the pump stops again. **Conditions to set
the alarm** If the Pump runs continually for more than 60 seconds or if it
starts and stops more than 15 times when draining the Water tank the yellow
alarm 110305711/110305712 occurs. **Trouble shooting**

  * Make sure that all the valves are functioning correctly and are in the correct position.
  * Make sure that the pump is running correctly.
  * Make sure that the level probes in the Water tank are functioning and are correctly set.
  * Make sure that the level relay is correctly set. The conductivity of the ice water media has an effect on the sensitivity of the system.- If the Pump runs continually for more than 60 seconds the R-value probably needs to be increased according to Level Control Relay - Set or Level Control Relay - Set.- If the Pump starts and stops more than 15 times when draining the Water tank the R-value probably needs to be decreased according to Level Control Relay - Set or Level Control Relay - Set.

### Functional Description

The logger is part of the Installation to Performance ( **ITP** ) system.The
main function of the **ITP** system is to make sure that the different supply
parameters to the machine are within the specified limits. The machine will
only work at maximum efficiency if these specifications are met. **Measured
Parameters** The measured supply systems are:Supply system:| Measured
parameters:  
---|---  
 **CIP**|  Return flow on side 1Return flow on side 2Return pressure on side
1Return pressure on side 2  
Ice water| Inlet flowInlet temperature  
Product| Pressure on side 1Pressure on side 2  
Steam| Steam pressure  
All of these measured parameters are continually recorded on a logger. This
log can be used both on the logger itself and on a computer for more detailed
analysis. **Alarms** If the measured parameters are outside of the specified
limits, a blue or yellow alarm will be triggered. These alarms mean that
something inside or outside of the machine must be corrected.The alarm levels
have been set so that the machine will function at maximum efficiency. If the
specified parameters are not followed, the machine will malfunction and
require more downtime.The alarm levels are:Media| Specification*| Alarm limit|

 **ITP Logger** The **ITP** logger is situated in the filling section
electrical cabinet and records all of the measured parameters on its memory
card. This memory card has enough room to record continually for 15 months.
The log from the **ITP** logger can be used to diagnose the supply systems and
to find the cause of any alarms that may occur. This diagnosis becomes much
easier if you move the log files from the memory card to a computer, where you
can use an add-in for Microsoft Excel to present the data in several different
ways.[//]: # (Start of section about Logger - Set a Name For The Logger)

## Logger RVG200

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The logger is part of the Installation to Performance ( **ITP** ) system.The
main function of the **ITP** system is to make sure that the different supply
parameters to the machine are within the specified limits. The machine will
only work at maximum efficiency if these specifications are met. **Measured
Parameters** The measured supply systems are:Supply system:| Measured
parameters:  
---|---  
 **CIP**|  Return flow on side 1Return flow on side 2Return pressure on side
1Return pressure on side 2  
Ice water| Inlet flowInlet temperature  
Product| Pressure on side 1Pressure on side 2  
Steam| Steam pressure  
All of these measured parameters are continually recorded on a logger. This
log can be used both on the logger itself and on a computer for more detailed
analysis. **Alarms** If the measured parameters are outside of the specified
limits, a blue or yellow alarm will be triggered. These alarms mean that
something inside or outside of the machine must be corrected.The alarm levels
have been set so that the machine will function at maximum efficiency. If the
specified parameters are not followed, the machine will malfunction and
require more downtime.The alarm levels are:Media| Specification*| Alarm limit|

 **ITP Logger** The **ITP** logger is situated in the filling section
electrical cabinet and records all of the measured parameters on its memory
card. This memory card has enough room to record continually for 15 months.
The log from the **ITP** logger can be used to diagnose the supply systems and
to find the cause of any alarms that may occur. This diagnosis becomes much
easier if you move the log files from the memory card to a computer, where you
can use an add-in for Microsoft Excel to present the data in several different
ways.[//]: # (Start of section about Logger - Set a Name For The Logger)

[//]: # (Start of section about Service Functions)

### Service Functions

Safety HazardAlways reset all the functions and make sure that the machine is
cleaned and sterilised before using the machine to produce packages.The
service functions bypass safeguards that have been put in place to ensure that
the machine is run safely and that the packages that are produced are safe and
hygienic for the consumer.

[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure
(explained above in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003526015.png)

The service function window contains several functions that will help you when
servicing the machine. To reach it you turn the service key and to leave it
you reset the key.The functions in this window are meant to be used during
service and it is very important that the machine is reset and cleaned before
it is used in production again.It is possible to leave the service function
window at any time while the service key is turned. To return to the window
you press the service function symbol that appears over the ladder. This
symbol will always be shown as long as a service function is being used.To use
a function you click the field that you want to use and then use the buttons
that appear to toggle between active and inactive.[//]: # (The image below is
used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003526014.png)

1| `Reset CIP/SIP` PLC Program – This function is used to terminate and reset
the **PLC program** if the program has locked up or not been completed
properly.It is absolutely forbidden to use this function for service purposes
or to stop a running CIP/SIP process.  
---|---  
2| `Reg. Valve` – This function is used when you service the regulator
valve.The regulator valve can not be disassembled unless it is fully open.
This function opens the valve.  
3| `Interlock SIP & Tankfilling` – It is normally not possible to step up to
Tankfilling without first doing a SIP, or perform a **SIP** without first
doing a **CIP**.This function resets and sets the interlock between the
Tankfilling /SIP and SIP/CIP . After the service function has been reset, a
CIP is forced by the machine.

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0003526009.png)

4| `Override tank Level` – During service it is often necessary to run
packages through the machine but it is not always possible to get product or
water to the filling tank. This function makes the machine think that it has a
full tank and you can then step up the machine and produce empty packages.  
---|---  
5| `Package section` – This function brings up the service window for the
package section.  
6| `Volume change` – This function aborts a volume change and can be used if a
problem occurs during one.

7| `Override DE` – During service it can be necessary to run the machine
without running the DE equipment that it is connected to. This function makes
it possible to run the machine only, without the DE equipment starting up.  
---|---  
8| `Water Test` \- Particulate Filling Only. This function is used to load
parameters, more suitable for filling water, to the filling system for test
purpose.  
9| `LFU` – This function brings up the service window for the LFU.  
10| `TTCU ` PLC Program – This function is used to terminate and reset the
**PLC program** if the program has locked up or not been properly completed.It
is absolutely forbidden to use this function for service purposes or to stop a
running TTCU process. After the function has been reset the machine will not
force the operator to run a new hygiene chamber cleaning sequence. It is
important that this is done  
11| `Pipe Drain` – This function drains the return pump and the pipes above
the pump that are used during hygiene cleaning.

This describes the function on side 1. See the following translation table for
side 2.Side 1| Side 2| Function  
---|---|---

V51B1247| V51B2247| Shutter switch  
V51Q1013| V51Q2013| Contactor (2 kW)  
V51Q1014| V51Q2014| Contactor (2 kW)  
 **Condition during ignition phase** Since the shutter is closed when the lamp
is to be ignited, there is only current going through one of the 2 kW ballast
coils. This current is too small to ignite the UV-lamp. The lamp needs current
from both ballast coils (4 kW) to be ignited. To make this possible when the
shutter is closed, control unit V51K1004 is used. **Function of control unit
V51K1004** During the ignition phase of the UV-lamp, the control unit V51K1004
bypasses the shutter switch V51B1247 and activates contactor V51Q1014
(V51K1004:9). Together, contactor V51Q1013 and control unit V51K1004 make it
possible to deliver 4 kW power to the UV-lamp.During the ignition phase, when
the intensity of the UV-lamp increases, control unit V51K1004 measures the
increased voltage (V51K1004:6 and 7). When the voltage reaches a certain
level, after about 10 to 20 seconds, control unit V51K1004 disconnects
contactor V51Q1014. The UV-lamp power then goes down to 2 kW.The red LED on
control unit V51K1004 is lit during the ignition phase when contactor V51Q1014
is activated. When the correct voltage is reached after about 10 to 20
seconds, the LED goes off and contactor V51Q1014 is deactivated.The ignition
phase can also be observed by looking at the UV-lamp with the shutter
closed.The UV-lamp will ignite and the intensity will increase during 10 to 20
seconds. The intensity will then drop when control unit V51K1004 disconnects
contactor V51Q1014 and the UV-lamp power goes down to 2 kW.After the ignition
phase, the regulation of 2 kW or 4 kW power to the UV-lamp is controlled by
shutter switch V51B1247. See Section Normal Shutter Control. **Setting control
unit V51K1004** Control unit V51K1004 is set by the manufacturer when
delivered. Normally it does not need any adjustment. But, since there are
manufacturing tolerances between UV-lamps, it might be necessary to adjust the
control unit V51K1004. See Procedure 7.2.2.4-1 Control Unit, 3060 - Set UV-
lamp Limit.[//]: # (Start of section about Normal Shutter Control)

### Normal Shutter Control

When the **UV** lamp is on and contactor V51Q1013 is activated, for example,
during motor running, the V51B1247 shutter contact inside the UV-housing
hardware controls the power of the lamp (half or full power) by switching
contactor V51Q1014 ON and OFF. **Shutter closed:** Only contactor V51Q1013 is
activated, 2kW. The UV lamp is on half power. **Shutter open:** Contactor
V51Q1014 is activated by hardware and adds 2kW to the 2kW from contactor
V51Q1013. The **UV** lamp is on full power, 4kW.[//]: # (Start of section

Hazardous voltage.Be careful when measuring the voltage, and always measure
the voltage when the lamp is already **On**. Never measure the voltage during
the start of ignition.Will shock, burn or cause death. The UV system generates
very high voltage in the start of the ignition phase, when going from lamp
**Off** to lamp **On** , igniterV51V1035 sends more than 1000V.

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Turn on the **UV** lamp with the `Package Disinfection` service function (See Chapter 2 Control Panels in the Operator Manual), or step the machine up to Motor On.
    2. Make sure that the UV-lamp is on.
    3. Leave the lamp on for at least 3 minutes, check that the UV Cooling Fan V51M1245 (F/C V51T1032) is running.
    4. Open the shutter with the `Package Disinfection` service function (see UV-lamp - Check Intensity), or override it in the **PLC** program.
    5. Check that the **UV** light is on.
    6. Make sure that contactors V51Q1013 and V51Q1014 are activated (4 kW).
    7. Make sure that contactor V51Q1017 is **not** activated (5 kW).
    8. Check the voltage between igniter V51V1035:D and V51V1035:L2. This is the voltage over the lamp. The voltage must be approximately 290V TrueRMS.
    9. Close the shutter.
    10. The **LED** on the control unit must be off , and contactor V51Q1014 must be off. (The control unit controls contactor V51Q1014 during the lamp ignition phase). If they are not off, turn the potentiometer to the left until the **LED** is turned off and contactor V51Q1014 goes off.
    11. Wait for at least 3 minutes.
    12. Make a new measurement on the lamp voltage. It must be approximately 260V TrueRMS.
    13. Turn the Potentiometer on the control unit (V51K1004) to the right until the LED turns on, and then turn the potentiometer to the left approximately 4 to 5 turns. (1 turn is approximately 7V).

There are two LEDs on the current relay V51R0002, one green and one yellow.The
Green LED is lit when current relay V51R0002 is connected to power. The Yellow
LED is lit when current through the relay is higher than the set-point
value.The function of the current relay is to measure the current to UV-lamp
when contactor V51Q1014 is engaged. When the contactor V51Q1014 is engaged,
(shutter open or ignition phase) the Yellow LED is lit when the measured
current is higher than the set-point value (I-value) and at the same time
relay output is high (V51R0002:14).As soon as the contactor V51Q1014 is
disengaged the Yellow LED turns off and relay output goes low.[//]: # (The

### Functional Description

The PLC system handles all functions for controlling the machine. The Logic
CPU executes the logic functions of the machine, that is, stepping up and down
and the actions of pneumatic actuators, alarms, and so on. The Motion CPU
executes the parts in the machine concerning motion, that is, controlling the
servomotors. The logic **CPU** and the motion **CPU** exchange information
regarding ladder position, alarms, volume, and bottom format. **Note:** The
NRG logger stops working if the communication between configured distribution
equipment and TPOP breaks for some reason. For example, if:

  * TPOP is restarted when the distribution equipment is switched off.
  * the distribution equipment is restarted.
  * the distribution equipment loses power.

If this happens, make sure the configured distribution equipment is switched
on, communication is re-established, and restart the TPOP. For instructions on
how to check communication status, see Section PLMS NRG – DE Overview.[//]: #

An **EDS** File, Electronic Data Sheet, is a simple text file that is used for
identification of the product in the Rockwell Software programs.Already
released products (products with a Tetra Pak 9xxxx-xxxx spare part number) may
be delivered with new firmware revisions not installed on your computer. The
Rockwell Software programs do not recognize it and will only show a question
mark on that position. If so, you have to install a new **EDS** file with the
same revision number as the product connected. **Note:** It is important that
you are administrator on your computer, otherwise you will still have
communication problems between RSLinx and the new device after EDS-
installation.

    1. Go to the Rockwell site: [http://www.rockwellautomation.com/rockwellautomation/](http://www.rockwellautomation.com/rockwellautomation/support/networks/eds.page?).
    2. Read the text and **EDS** Search Tips on the right. 
    3. Search for the **EDS** file. The example below shows a search for an **EDS** file for a **DNB** scanner firmware revision 10.

#### I/O Fault Codes

The controller indicates I/O faults on the status display in one of these
formats:• I/O Fault Local: _X #XXXX message_ • I/O Fault _ModuleName #XXXX
message_ • I/O Fault _ModuleParent: X #XXXX message_ The first part of the
format is used to indicate the location of the module with a fault. How the
location is indicated depends on your I/O configuration and the properties of
the module that are specified in Logix Designer application.The latter part of
the format, #XXXX message, can be used to diagnose the type of I/O fault and
potential corrective actions.I/O Fault Codes

### PLC Controller - Mark and Trace Local PLC Adaptations

[//]: # (The table below contains the prerequisites for the procedure.)
Equipment Status| Program Step  
---|---  
  
Personnel Requirements.Only authorised and skilled personnel are allowed to
make changes in the **PLC** program.Changing the **PLC** program can affect
the machine in unexpected ways.

All local adaptations must, if possible, be made inside the program
`LocalAdaptations`. Changes and adaptations that are not inside the
`LocalAdaptations` program must be marked according to below.[//]: # (The
image below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above
in text))

![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000151901.png)

 **Note:** For further information, see the Electrical Manual (EM).[//]: #
(The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Mark the Rung, where the adaptation is, with the tag `LA_LocalAdaptation` to do a local adaptation in the **PLC** program. This tag is always on.In the example below, a main shaft position has been adjusted and marked with the `LA_LocalAdaptation` tag.
[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure
(explained above in text))

### Distributed I/O

 **Note:** Series mismatch.When replacing a component that contains firmware,
it is important that the components have the same series as the old ones.
**Note:** Revision mismatch.It might be possible to use a component with a new
revision, but it is recommended to use the same revision as the old one.The
series and revision is printed on the component.[//]: # (Start of section
about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The communication and connections between different devices in the machine is
provided through a DeviceNet network. The higher-level devices, such as
controllers are connected to more simple devices such as sensors, actuators,
and other parts.In addition to reading the states of on/off sensors and
operating motor starters, the DeviceNet network reports temperatures and the
load current in the motor starter, changes the deceleration rates of drives,
adjusts the sensitivities of sensors, and more.[//]: # (Start of section about
DeviceNet)

### DeviceNet

In the TT/3 machine there are three DeviceNet networks, DeviceNet 1, DeviceNet
2, and DeviceNet 3. To see which DeviceNet node that belongs to which network,
see the table that starts on page
[Reference](NodeTrunkLineFuncNoNameSwitchPositi-19D56D6E).A Control Logix PLC
and three DeviceNet scanners 1756-DNB are installed in the electrical
cabinet.The DeviceNet scanners 1756-DNB is a communication interface between
the Control Logix PLC and the DeviceNet network. The DeviceNet scanner scans
the network and reads and writes data from and to the network nodes.[//]: #

The logic **CPU** communicates with the Point I/O modules and the frequency
converters through the three DeviceNet scanners A01K0030, A01K0031, and
A01K0039. The DeviceNet scanners are located in place 3, 4, and 12 of the
**CPU** rack in the electrical cabinet. From each scanner there are two trunk
lines, one to the frequency converter in the electrical cabinet and one for
the Point I/O and the frequency converter on the filling machine. A
termination resistor must be connected between the blue and white connection
on the end of each trunk line from the scanners.The trunk line is the cable
path between terminators that serves as the backbone of the DeviceNet network.
The trunk line connects to taps or directly to devices. A tap is screw
terminals that connect a drop line to the trunk line.The modules that are
connected to each scanner must have an individual address, a node number. The
setting of the node numbers on the Point I/O (9 pieces of P I/O) modules is
done on the Thumb wheel on the first **ADN** module. Setting of address number
and baud rate, see section DeviceNet Scanner Module - Set Address Number and
Baud Rate on page DeviceNet Scanner Module - Set Address Number and Baud
Rate.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the procedure

 **Note:** It is important that the modules are connected to the proper
scanner. See the table below. The reciprocal order is not important since the
modules are connected in parallel, but it is important that the last module in
each loop have a termination resistor connected between the blue and white
connection (121 Ohm, 1%, ¼ W).Node| Trunk line| Func No| Name| Switch

### I/O Modules

DeviceNet nodes are placed on the machine modules such as Point I/O adapters
(1734-ADN) and frequency converters (PowerFlex40), see the illustration
below.The Point I/O node signals are wired to the I/O modules.I/O modules come
in a wide range of different types. Digital, analogue, and thermocouple I/O
modules are used in the TT/3 machine.[//]: # (Start of section about Adapter
(1734-ADN))

### Adapter (1734-ADN)

The adapter (1734-ADN) has double functionality. On the backplane it acts as
an I/O scanner to the I/O modules and collects the I/O data. On the main
DeviceNet it acts as an adapter, and data is collected by the 1756-DNB
module.There are different ways of communicating with the I/O modules. This
means that there are different delay times compared to a non distributed I/O
solution.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the

### PowerFlex40 (PF40)

PowerFlex40 (PF40) is a frequency drive on the DeviceNet. All of the drive
parameters are downloaded from the DeviceNet scanner 1756-DNB when the drive
is powered on.[//]: # (Start of section about Status Indicators)

### Status Indicators

On each DeviceNet node there are **LED** s; 1743-ADN indicators (1),
PowerFlex40 indicators (2), and LED on I/O modules (3), indicating the status
of the module and the network communication. It is possible to see on the
**LED** if something is wrong with the network devices which simplifies
maintenance and
troubleshooting.![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000365119.png)

### Configuration Tools

By using the software RSLogix5000 and RSNetworx for DeviceNet the network and
the **PLC** system can be configured.[//]: # (Start of section about Power
Supply and Cable Coding)

### Power Supply and Cable Coding

Each of the networks is connected to a separate 24 VDC power supply and has a
terminating resistor ( _TR_ ) (121 ohm), attached to the ends of the trunk
line.The Drop line is the cable path that connects taps to nodes on the
network.The Device box is a junction box that allows two, four or eight drop
lines to be connected to the trunk line via terminal strip connections.The
network cable is colour coded to avoid wiring
faults:![Illustration](https://stsp3lqew6l65ci.blob.core.windows.net/illustrations/0000151979.png)|

All parameters to the frequency converters are stored in the DeviceNet project
and downloaded to the DeviceNet scanner.The DeviceNet communication card in
the frequency converter is internally supplied when the power (230-400VAC) to
the frequency converter goes on.All frequency converter comm cards have an
individual node number for correct addressing of parameters to the frequency
converters.An automatic parameter transfer, from the DeviceNet scanner, is
executed when the connection to the frequency converter comm card is
established (the tree **LED** : PORT, MOD, and NET A has a steady green
light).If any parameter changes have been made manually on the buttons on the
frequency converter, they will be restored to the values stored in the
DeviceNet scanner when the frequency converter is supplied with power again.If
a single parameter has to be changed, or if the parameters to a frequency
converter in the project have been set to factory setting, follow the
procedure below. Look in the table for correct parameter values.

#### Description

The procedure describes how to install DeviceNet configuration in **DNB**
scanner and **ADN** scanner after rebuilding a Point I/O node or to a new
Point I/O node.

#### Terminology

    *  **DNB** = the main scanners installed in the electrical cabinet (1756-DNB)
    *  **ADN** = the Point I/O scanners (1734-ADN)
    * Download = Install configuration in a scanner from a computer
    * Upload = Read information from a scanner to a computer

#### Work Flow

1| Preparations  
---|---  
2| Turn OFF the Main Power Supply Disconnector  
3| Rebuild the Point I/O Node  
4| Turn ON the Main Power Supply Disconnector  
5| Start an Empty Project in RSNetWorx  
6| Download an Empty Project to the ADN Scanner  
7| Download an Empty Project to the DNB Scanner  
8| Upload the Point I/O ADN Scanner to the Computer  
9| Execute an Automatic Numbering of the I/O Modules to the Point I/O ADN
Scanner  
10| Connect to Point I/O ADN Scanner and Download the New Configuration  
11| Connect to DNB Scanner and Download the New Configuration  
12| Start Up the System  
  
#### Preparations

The following preparations **must** be made:

    * DeviceNet files on the computer.
      * Make sure that all NetWorx files are placed in the folder Networks, with the address: C:\200v Program\Projects\Networks
      * Before working with the files, make a backup of them. Save the backup in another folder on the computer in case of any fault during download.
      * If the files are saved to the address above the function Associated Network… in the NetWorx software can be used. Using this function it is possible to jump between the **DNB** DeviceNet file and the **ADN** files related to this file.
    * Turn off the firewall.
      * If there is a firewall installed on the computer, make sure that it is turned off.
    * Turn off the Logic **CPU**.
      * Set the Logic **CPU** in step program.
      * The indicator run goes off.
      * Download of the DeviceNet configuration can **not** be done when the **CPU** is in step run.

#### Turn OFF the Main Power Supply Disconnector

Before rebuilding the Point I/O node, make sure that all 24 V supply is turned
off.Mains voltage:

    * Normal 24 V
    * Class II 24 V **Note:** It is recommended to turn off the main power supply disconnector Q001.

#### Rebuild the Point I/O Node

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Assemble the Point I/O node according to the new drawing.
    2. Make sure to put the correct type of bottom slices in the correct places.
    3. Make sure that the sheet metal shields between the bottom slices have contact with each other.
    4. Make sure to put the correct type of I/O module in the correct bottom slice.
    5. Make sure that the interlocking side pieces are in the correct position.

#### Turn ON the Main Power Supply Disconnector

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Turn on both the 24 V mains voltage and the Point I/O 24 V supply.
    2. Make sure that the top green **LED** in the **ADN** scanner and all the I/O modules are lit.
    3. At this point the Pointbus status indicator on the **ADN** scanner will be lit with a red light because the node differs from the old configuration that still remains in the **ADN** scanner (for example one I/O module has been added).

#### Start an Empty Project in RSNetWorx

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Start the RSNetWorx software or open an existing DeviceNet file.
    2. Click New to open a new empty project. **Note:** The illustration shows an empty project.

Missing| The device shown in the network configuration either is offline or it
is **not** connected to the network.  
If the **ADN** scanner is marked with a Missing symbol it has **not** been
found in the network. In this case take the following action:- Disconnect from
the network.- Connect to the network again.- Check if the `Missing` symbol has
gone off. - If the Missing symbol has **not** gone off:- Close the project.-
Open the project.- Connect to the network.- Check if the `Missing` symbol has
gone off. If neither of these actions makes the `Missing` symbol go off make
sure that:- the node is connected.- the power to the node is turned on.- the
node address is correct. It is also important to check that there are 121 Ohm
termination resistors placed in the correct positions in the network. See
Distributed I/O, table on page Distributed I/O.

If one or several modules are marked with Missing symbols the reasons can be
that:- the automatic re-numbering procedure is **not** finished.- the bottom
slices are **not** correctly installed, the sheet metal shields are **not** in
contact with each other.In this case, disconnect from the network and then
connect again.It may be necessary to close the project, open it again and then
connect to the network. But first make sure that the bottom slices are correct
installed.If this does **not** make the missing symbols go off, it is
necessary to redo the automatic re-numbering procedure. Start over from Start

 **Auto Restart (Reset/Run)** The Auto Restart feature provides the ability
for the drive to automatically perform a fault reset followed by a start
attempt without user or application intervention. This allows remote or
“unattended” operation. Only certain faults are allowed to be reset. Certain
faults (Type 2) that indicate possible drive component malfunction are not
resettable. Fault types are listed in the table Fault Types. See Fault
Descriptions for more information.Use caution when enabling this feature,
since the drive will attempt to issue its own start command based on user
selected programming.Display| LED State| Description

The PLC system handles all functions for controlling the servomotors in the
machine. The Logic CPU executes the logic functions of the machine, that is,
stepping up and down and the actions of pneumatic actuators, alarms and so on.
The Motion CPU executes the parts in the machine concerning motion, that is
controlling the servomotors. The logic **CPU** and the motion **CPU** exchange
information regarding ladder position, alarms, volume and bottom format.The
Motion CPU communicates with the servo control cards, called Sercos card 1 and
Sercos card 2 through the Backplane of the **PLC** rack.The Sercos card 1 and
Sercos card 2 communicates through an Optical fibre network with the Servo
rack containing the power supply and the Servo drive.Through the Power cable
the drive provides power to the Servomotor and the motor position is sent to
the drive through the Feedback cable.If the connected motor is equipped with a
mechanical brake the brake function is integrated in the Power cable.[//]: #

### Sercos Card

Sercos is a fibre-optic communication standard used for motion control. There
are two Sercos cards in the TT/3 machine, Sercos card (A9205) and Sercos card
(A9206) which control the Servo rack of servo drives (10 Additional servo
drives for variant XH with IC).The Sercos cards and the drives are connected
in a ring topology, see the illustration below. The card transmits data from
the Sercos transmit (Tx) port of the card or the drive, and receives data on
the Sercos receive (Rx) port of the card or the drive. These ports are located
on top of the drives, and on the bottom of the Sercos cards. For further
information see section Sercos Card, page Sercos Card.[//]: # (The image below

  6. Additional servo drives for variant XH with IC

Communication between the cards and the drives is performed at a certain
speed, called baud rate. The DIP switch settings on the drives and software
settings on the Sercos cards determine the baud rate. For further information
see section Servo Drive - Set Baud Rate.[//]: # (The image below is used to
illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

### Servo Rack

The Integrated Axis Module IAM provides power to the Servo drive in the Servo
rack, and at the same time serves as a drive to one servomotor.Each rack has a
base node number, which is set by two Switch on the IAM.The rack is powered
with 400 VAC at the Power connector on top of the IAM to run the
servomotors.Control power (240 VAC) to the drives in the rack is supplied
through the Control power connector on top of the IAM.A DC bus provides the
drives in the rack with DC power through the backplane. If a slot in the rack
is empty, a Slot filler, which prevents access to the DC bus power bar, is
installed.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the
procedure (explained above in text))

[//]: # (Start of section about Servo Drive)

### Servo Drive

Each servo drive has a node number which is determined by the base node number
set on the IAM and numbered depending on which rack-slot the drive is located
in. The seven segment Fault status LED on the drive shows different code
sequences depending on the status of the drive:

  * When the mains power is switched ON, the digits 1 and 2 are alternated. This is when parameters are sent from the Sercos card to the drives. 
  * When displaying 3 a check is made to determine that the correct servomotor is connected to the drive. 
  * At 4 the system is running.

Errors are displayed as an error message containing the letter E followed by
two digits. An example of an error message sequence is E19: E – dark – 1 –
dark – 9. This is the error code when the drive has tripped for Position
error. For more information about the error codes, see Servo System - General
Troubleshoot on page Servo System - General Troubleshoot.[//]: # (The image

illustration.)

  1.  **LED** Fault status 

There are three more LED showing the status of the drive.

  * The upper LED, Drive Status, is OFF in normal condition and red if there is a fault.
  * The middle LED, COMM Status, is OFF when there is no communication, that is when the fibre optic connection is loose, broken or incorrect connected. It flashes green when establishing communication and shows steady green when communication is established.
  * The lower LED, Bus Status, is OFF when there is no bus power present. It flashes green when bus power is present but the axis is disabled and shows steady green when bus power is present and the axis is enabled. 

On the bottom of the drive there are three D-sub connectors.

  * The left one 26-PIN D-sub connector for I/O communication is for I/O communications with the drive, for example home sensors, bar code sensors, enable signal, etc.
  * The middle one 15-PIN D-sub connector for position feedback is for position feedback from the motor.
  * The right one 15-PIN D-sub connector (not used in TT/3) is for position feedback from an auxiliary device (not used on TT/3).

Machines that are equipped with Kinetix 6000 can sometimes have sporadic drive
restarts or similar faults that are related to lost SERCOS
communication.Servomotors can cause the SERCOS ring drop fault if the
shielding is not correctly clamped to the servo drive shield connector. This
is valid mostly for servo drives with the old type of clamping.

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

If a fault is connected to SERCOS, follow the instructions:

  1. Check the connectors on all servomotor cables, especially grounding and shield connections.
  2. If hardware fault is suspected, exchange the hardware with a similar hardware in the machine. If the fault is transferred, replace the hardware. If the fault remains in the same place, change back again.
  3. Check all terminals that are related to the servo drive supply and safety. Check for loose wire and corrosion.
  4. Check all fibre optic cables. If there is any suspected damage or discontinuous bend on the radius, replace the cable. If the cable connectors are contaminated inside, clean or replace them.
    5. Rearrange the shield clamping on top of the drives even if it looks correct. See the illustration below. Make sure that there is contact between the cables.

    13. Check the cable route, local adaptations, and the hardware changes on the drive systems (for example extra sensors or connections to drives). Document and try to assess the **EMC** compliance. If there is uncertainties, contact EMC specialists.
    14. Check the servomotor grounding and connectors. If there are abnormalities, repair or replace the connectors. Bayonet connectors can sometimes have mechanical play, use cable ties to reduce unwanted play.
    15. Measure the power supply to the machine, voltage fluctuations greater than 10% of nominal is not recommended.
    16. Make sure that the firmware on the **PLC** SERCOS communication card is revision 15.37 or higher.
    17. Check the firmware. The recommended firmware is ≥1.125 and <1.132. **Note:** Drives with firmware higher than 1.132, cannot be degraded again.
    18. Exchange the SERCOS cards in the main electrical cabinet. If the problem transfers to the other SERCOS ring, replace the PLCSERCOScard.

The emergency stop buttons and stop cords, are connected by two channels, one
constant +24 VDC and one pulse shaped voltage from the safety **PLC** (Pluto).
Both channels have to be opened and closed at the same time to allow the
system to reset, however it is enough that one channel is open to make the
system trip. The Adam/Eva safety switches for the doors are operating with one
channel, the puls shaped voltage form the safety **PLC**. The system monitors
the contactors that will be turned off when the system trip. If a feedback
circuit is not OK after the system has tripped it is not possible to reset.For

A Pluto unit cannot change baud rate during operation. If a unit is loaded
with a program with new baud rate, it will continue with the old baud rate and
indicate error code Er26. The error code Er26 indicates that a unit is running
with another baud rate than it is programmed for. Change baud rate by
rebooting the Pluto **PLC** :

    1. Reboot by Power Off/On, or
    2. via Pluto Manager by selecting the `Tools` menu and then selecting Reset all Plutos.

  1.  **TTCU** alarm symbol

The Safety system alarm symbol indicates that the system has not been restored
despite that the **PLC** monitors all safety doors, and EMERGENCY STOP buttons
and emergency stop cords are ok.The reason for the alarm is probably the
following:

    * Missing input or feedback signal to the Pluto system. Look for **UE** -code on the Pluto displays (two Pluto modules in electrical cabinet and one in **ASU** electrical cabinet) and see Procedure Pluto - UE-Code List TT/3 on page Pluto - UE-Code List TT/3.
    * Fault code display on the Pluto system. Look for Er-code on the Pluto displays and see Procedure Pluto B20 Troubleshooting - Fault Code List on page Pluto B20 Troubleshooting - Fault Code List.
    * Badly aligned and adjusted door guard sensors causing unstable signals to the Pluto and **PLC** system. See **LED** instruction below or setting Procedure Safety Switch - Set on page Safety Switch - Set.
    * A tripped 24VDC fuse. Check fuses for XL11:1-8 or XL12:1-6 or XL21, XL22, XL31, XL32.

#### Reset Pulse from Relay to the Pluto System

In order to restore the safety system after an emergency stop, an open door or
a safety system error, **UE** or **Er** -code, the Pluto system need a 24 V on
and off reset pulse to F03K0016:IQ14. The reset pulse comes from relay
F03K0009. This is activated when restoring the emergency stop line or when
acknowledging a door guard alarm on the **TPOP**.If a Pluto module displays an
**UE** -code (safety system error) due to a channel fault or a feedback error,
the faulted circuit must be corrected first, to be able to remove the **UE**
-code by a reset pulse.

#### Reset Relay F03K0009

If the **PLC** does not activate the reset relay it can be made manually. Pull
down the blue Cover shield on relay F03K0009 with a small screwdriver and push
the Yellow button underneath for a short while.[//]: # (The image below is

#### EDEN, Adam/Eva Sensors

Eden, Adam/Eva is a non-contact sensor with dynamic signal transmission (10 V
pulse).Several Eden connectors can be connected to the same safety circuit
(Tina 4 A or Tina 8 A) and be monitored dynamically by the Pluto safety
**PLC**.An info signal (24 V) from each sensor is used in the **PLC** machine
program for monitoring the individual doors on the machine.[//]: # (The image

#### Tina 4A and Tina 8A Connector Blocks

Door guards belonging to the same safety circuit are connected to the
connector blocks.Unused connections must be filled out with Tina 1A connectors
to obtain the safety circuit signal through the block.An info signal (24V)
from each Adam/Eva sensor is distributed from the connector block to a **PLC**
input and is used in the **PLC** machine program for monitoring the doors
individually on the machine.Carton Section| Package Section

The Tina 1A is working as jumpers for the dynamic signal (10V pulse) in the
safety circuit and is needed on the unused positions on Tina 8A connector
blocks. **Note:** A Tina 1A connector can not be used as a substitute for an
Adam/Eva door guard since the info signal (24V) from the Adam /Eva sensor to
the machine PLC is missing.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the

#### Termination resistors on the Pluto Bus

A 120 Ohm resistor must be connected between **CL** and **CH** terminals on
the first and last Pluto module in the Bus.If you have only one machine
connected to a **TTCU** it means that the Pluto module in the **ASU** and the
**TTCU** shall have a resistor. Resistors on the other Pluto modules must be
removed for correct impedance on the Bus.If you have two machines connected to
one **TTCU** it means that the Pluto modules in **ASU** on both machines shall
have a resistor. Resistors on the other Pluto modules must be removed for
correct impedance on the Bus.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate

#### Comment on Inputs/Outputs on Pluto 27 (TTCU)

I0, I1| It is important that these two inputs, from Emergency Stops on the
TTCU, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel fault
will occur and the UE code 01 is displayed on the Pluto.If UE code 00 is shown
on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is permanent missing.  
---|---  
I2, I3| It is important that these two input, from External Emergency Stops to
the TTCU, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel
fault will occur and the UE code 03 is displayed on the Pluto. Permanent
jumpers are connected to terminals if no external emergency stop is connected.
If UE code 02 is shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is
permanent missing.  
I4, I5, I6| Not used  
I7| This feedback signal goes through and monitors the contactors that should
be off when an emergency stop has been activated (button pushed. I0, I1 or I2,
I3 is off). If everything is correct (contactors are off) the Input will be on
(LED lit). The safety system can then be restored when the reset signal to
Pluto 27: IQ11 goes on and off again. If there is no signal to the I7 when an
emergency stop has been activated the Pluto will show UE code 07 and the
safety system can not be restored.  
IQ10| Dynamic output pulse +10V (A-Pulse) created in the Pluto system.  
IQ11| In order to restore the safety system in the TTCU after an emergency
stop or safety system error (UE-code) the Pluto system need a 24V on and off
pulse to this input. The reset pulse comes from relay F73K0202. This is
activated from the reset button on the TTCU. If a Pluto module displays an UE-
code (safety system error) due to a channel fault or a feedback error, the
faulted circuit must be corrected first, to be able to remove the UE-code by a
reset pulse. A reset pulse can also be made manually with a small screwdriver
by pulling down the blue cover shield on relay F73K0202 and pushing the yellow
button underneath for a short while.

#### Comment on Inputs/Outputs on Pluto 3 (23)

I0, I1| It is important that these two input, from emergency stops on the
machine, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel
fault will occur and the UE code 01 is displayed on the Pluto.If UE code 00 is
shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is permanent missing.  
---|---  
I2, I3| It is important that these two input, from external emergency stops to
the machine, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two channel
fault will occur and the UE code 03 is displayed on the Pluto. Permanent
jumpers are connected to terminals if no external emergency stop is
connected.If UE code 02 is shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two
channels is permanent missing.  
I4| This feedback signal goes through and monitors the contactors that should
be off when an emergency stop has been activated (button pushed or a cord
pulled. I0, I1 or I2, I3 is off). The signal also monitors the shut down of
the filling servo rack #10 (safe off connections). If everything is correct
(contactors and servo rack is off) the input will be on (LED lit). The safety
system can then be restored when the reset signal to Pluto 4: IQ14 goes on and
off again. After reset the I4 will be off due to the fact that contactors and
servo rack activates when the safety system for emergency stop restores. If
there is no signal to the I4 when an emergency stop has been activated the
Pluto will show UE code 04 and the safety system can not be restored.  
I5| This feedback signal monitors the UV-lamp contactors off state for S1. If
there is no signal to the I5 when a door on package section on side 1 has been
opened the Pluto will show UE code 05 and the safety system can not be
restored.  
I6| This feedback signal monitors the UV-lamp contactors off state for S2.If
there is no signal to the I6when a door on package section on side 2 has been
opened the Pluto will show UE code 06 and the safety system can not be
restored.  
I7| This feedback signal goes through and monitors the contactors that should
be off when a door guard stop from package section has been activated (IQ12 or
IQ13 is off). The signal also monitors the shut down of the package section
servo rack #20 and #30 (safe off connections). If everything is correct
(contactors and servo rack is off) the Input will be on (LED lit). The safety
system can then be restored when the reset signal to Pluto 4: IQ14 goes on and
off again.After reset the I7 will be off due to the fact that contactors and
servo rack activates when the safety system for package section door guard
stop restores.If there is no signal to the I7 when a package section door
guard stop has been activated the Pluto will show UE code 07 and the safety
system can not be restored.  
IQ10| Dynamic output pulse +10V (A-Pulse) created in the Pluto system.  
IQ11| This input is on (LED lit) when the hatch between carton and package
section on S1 is closed. If it's closed the machine can make an intermediate
clean from TTCU while still running production on the other side of the
machine.  
IQ12| This input is on (LED lit) when the safety circuit for pack sect S1 is
ok. All doors (5) are closed and no Tina 1 connectors missing on the Tina 8
block.  
IQ13| This input is on (LED lit) when the safety circuit for pack sect S2 is
ok. All doors (5) are closed and no Tina 1 connectors missing on the Tina 8
block.  
IQ15, IQ16| Info signals from PLC  
IQ17| This output is on (LED lit) when everything in the Pluto module is ok.
If a fault occurs (shown by Er and a number in the display) or if a signal
fail to come, for instance a missing “Two channel signal” or a feedback
signal, (shown by UE and a number) the output goes off.  
0L| Supply terminal for relay output Q0. (Comes from a PLC output).  
Q0| When open a door on package section side 1 (IQ12 is off) this output goes
off.  
1L | Supply terminal for relay output Q1. (Comes from a PLC output).  
Q1| When open a door on package section side 2 (IQ13 is off) this output goes
off.  
Q2| When opening any door on package section (IQ12 or IQ13 is off) this output
goes off. **Note:** This output delivers -24V. This means that expansion
relays or contactors connected to it must be connected in opposite polarity.
(Machine L10 to + or A1 and Q2 to - or A2).  
Q3| When activating (external or internal) emergency stop (I0, I1 is off or
I2, I3 is off) this output goes off. **Note:** This output delivers -24V. This
means that expansion relays or contactors connected to it must be connected in
opposite polarity. (Machine L10 to + or A1 and Q3 to - or A2).

#### Comment on Inputs/Outputs on Pluto 4 (24)

I0, I1| It is important that these two input, from service switch in the
electrical cabinet, activate or deactivate at the same time. Otherwise a two
channel fault will occur and the UE code 01 is displayed on the Pluto.If UE
code 00 is shown on the Pluto it means that one of the two channels is
permanent missing.  
---|---  
I2| This input is on (LED lit) when the safety circuit for carton sect upper
S1 is ok. All doors (4 or 5 if CAU) are closed and no Tina 1 connectors
missing on the Tina 8 block.  
I3| This input is on (LED lit) when the safety circuit for carton sect upper
S2 is ok. All doors (4 or 5 if CAU) are closed and no Tina 1 connectors
missing on the Tina 8 block.  
I4, I5| Not used  
I6| This feedback signal goes through and monitors the contactors that should
be off when a door guard stop from carton section has been activated (I2, I3
or IQ12, IQ13 is off). The signal also monitors the shut down of the carton
section servo rack #40, #50, #60 (safe off connections). If everything is
correct (contactors and servo rack is off) the input will be on (LED lit). The
safety system can then be restored when the reset signal to Pluto 4: IQ14 goes
on and off again. After reset the I6 will be off due to the fact that
contactors and servo rack activates when the safety system for carton section
door guard stop restores.If there is no signal to the I6 when a carton section
door guard stop has been activated the Pluto will show UE code 06 and the
safety system can not be restored.  
I7| This feedback signal goes through and monitors if the contactors for
hydraulic pump is off when a door guard stop from carton section has been
activated (I2, I3 or IQ12, IQ13 is off). If everything is correct the input
will be on (LED lit). The safety system can then be restored when the reset
signal to Pluto 4: IQ14 goes on and off again. After reset the I7 may be off
due to the fact that contactors activates when the safety system for carton
section door guard stop restores.If there is no signal to the I7 when a carton
section door guard stop has been activated the Pluto will show UE code 07 and
the safety system can not be restored.  
IQ10| Dynamic output pulse +10V (A-Pulse) created in the Pluto system.  
IQ11| This input is on (LED lit) when the hatch between carton and package
section on S2 is closed. If it is closed the machine can make an intermediate
clean from TTCU while still running production on the other side of the
machine.  
IQ12| This input is on (LED lit) when the safety circuit for carton sect lower
S1 is ok. All doors are closed.  
IQ13| This input is on (LED lit) when the safety circuit for carton sect lower
S2 is ok. All doors are closed.  
IQ14| In order to restore the safety system after an emergency stop, an open
door or a safety system error (UE-code) the Pluto system need a 24V on and off
pulse to this input. The reset pulse comes from relay F03K0009. This is
activated from the TPOP when restoring an emergency stop button or an
emergency stop cord or when acknowledging a door guard alarm.If a Pluto module
displays an UE-code (safety system error) due to a channel fault or a feedback
error, the faulted circuit must be corrected first, to be able to remove the
UE-code by a reset pulse.A reset pulse can also be made manually with a small
screwdriver by pulling down the blue cover shield on relay F03K0009 and
pushing the yellow button underneath for a short while.  
IQ15, IQ16| Info signals to PLC  
IQ17| This output is on (LED lit) when everything in the Pluto module is ok.If
a fault occurs (shown by Er and a number in the display) or if a signal fail
to come, for instance a feedback signal, (shown by UE and a number) the output
goes off.  
0L, Q0| Not used  
1L| Supply terminal for relay output Q1. (Comes from L11).  
Q1| This output supply a PLC output module controlling the carton/package
hatches and is only activated when all doors on carton and package section are
closed.  
Q2| When opening any door on carton section (I2, I3, IQ12 or IQ13 is off) this
output goes off. **Note:** This output delivers -24V. This means that
expansion relays or contactors connected to it must be connected in opposite
polarity. (Machine L10 to + or A1 and Q2 to - or A2).  
Q3| This output goes off if:Service switch is in off position (I0, I1 off) and
any door on carton section is opened.Service switch is activated (I0, I1 lit)
and emergency stop is activated (I0, I1 is off or I2, I3 is off on Pluto 3).
**Note:** This output delivers -24V. This means that expansion relays or
contactors connected to it must be connected in opposite polarity. (Machine
L10 to + or A1 and Q3 to - or A2).  
  
#### Pluto 5 or 25, F03K0024 in TT/3 Electrical Cabinet in ASU

## HMI and PLMS

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The **HMI** is the control software that is graphically represented on the
touch screen as an interface for operating and controlling filling machines.
**PLMS** is the data management system for collecting, analysing, and
monitoring the operational performance of filling machines and packaging
lines. **Note:** The NRG logger stops working if the communication between
configured distribution equipment and TPOP breaks for some reason. For
example, if:

  * TPOP is restarted when the distribution equipment is switched off.
  * the distribution equipment is restarted.
  * the distribution equipment loses power.

If this happens, make sure the configured distribution equipment is switched
on, communication is re-established, and restart the TPOP. For instructions on
how to check communication status, see Section PLMS NRG – DE Overview.[//]: #

---|---  
Special Equipment| CD with Software  
The DASAbcip software is a communication server distributed by Wonderware and
used to implement communication between the **TPOP** and the Rockwell RSLogix
PLCs. Due to the introduction of RSLogix v19, the DASABcip server has to be
version4.1Sp2. The TPOPBasic3.3 already implements this version of DASAbcip,
but previous TPOPBasic3.1and3.2 do not (e.g. 3.2 contains Dasabcip 4.0.0).A
WinRar self-extracting archive contains the needed file to install the
DASAbcip server and auxiliary software as MicrosoftC++ redistributable
libraries and the Sentinel Protection. To simplify the installation, some
specific parameters are automatically set by the installation procedure, which
is implemented with an AutoItv3script.

#### Installation Procedure

[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

    1. Log on as an installer on the TPOP. See Procedure HMI and PLMS - Log on Procedure.
    2. Self-extraction of the files into the folder .

Special Equipment| Keyboard with PS/2 connector  
Configuration of the **IPC** **IP** settings allows the possibility to
communicate between TetraPak filling machines and a **PLMS** master PC using a
new or existing local area network. **LAN** communication provides a much
faster method of retrieving **PLMS** data and requires a much simpler hardware
setup than serial communication.The **PLMS** Send and **PLMS** Receive
software are no longer needed for communication between the **PLMS** master PC
and filling machines connected to the **LAN** , but can be retained as a means
of communication between **PLMS** master PCs and remote locations and offline
automation.

## IVC Camera

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The purpose of the vision system is to detect tilted screw caps (the torque
supervision in the **CAU** will guarantee that the screw caps are properly
tightened). The packages are scanned while passing the vision system on the
conveyer. The system uses a laser beam and a camera to scan the packages. The
reliability of the system will increase if the packages pass the vision system
with a smooth movement.Package scanning is activated by the photocell. If a
screw cap is tilted, the pusher will push the package of the conveyer. If the
package volume is changed the camera will automatically adjust to the new
package height. The vision system uses the Ethernet cable to communicate with
the **PLC**. Information about package volume are sent and **PLMS** data and
alarms are being transmitted to the **PLC**.The vision unit will make a
reading when the photocell is activated. To read the next package the
photocell must first be deactivated. Because of this there must be space
between the packages. Normally there is space between the packages, but if the
packages twist on the conveyer they will block the signal from the photocell
and the reading will not be performed.[//]: # (The image below is used to

TT3 2000[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The purpose of the vision system is to detect tilted screw caps (the torque
supervision in the **CAU** guarantees that the screw caps are correctly
tightened). The packages are scanned while passing the vision system on the
conveyor. The system uses a laser beam and a camera to scan the packages. If
the packages pass the vision system with a smooth movement, the reliability of
the system increases.Package scanning is activated by the photocell. If a
screw cap is not correctly attached, the pusher pushes the package off the
conveyor. The vision system uses the Ethernet cable to communicate with the
**PLC**. Information about package volume is sent and **PLMS** data and alarms
are being transmitted to the **PLC**.The vision unit makes a reading when the
photocell is activated. To read the next package, the photocell must first be
deactivated. Because of this, there must be space between the packages.
Normally there is space between the packages, but if the packages twist on the
conveyor, they block the signal from the photocell and the reading is not
performed.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the
procedure (explained above in text))

### Functional Description

The **TTCU** is connected to the TT/3 filling machine Pluto safety system and
it communicates with the TT/3 filling machine control system using DeviceNet.
The **TTCU** can be connected to two TT/3 filling machines, but can only
supply cleaning/disinfection solution to one machine at the time.When
cleaning/disinfection is selected on one of the TT/3 filling machines’
**TPOP** , the **TTCU** Pluto safety system sends a signal to the Pluto safety
system in the other TT/3 filling machine stating that the **TTCU** is **not**
idle. That signal is used to block the selection of the cleaning/disinfection
on that TT/3 filling machine’s **TPOP**. The Pluto safety system also switches
the **TTCU** DeviceNet between TT/3 filling machines.The TT/3 filling machine
that has connection with the DeviceNet loop in **TTCU** can perform
cleaning/disinfection, that means that the **TTCU** can be considered as one
node that is shared between the TT/3 filling machines.For more information and
procedures see chapter Electrical System.[//]: # (The image below is used to

## Logger SM1000

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The logger presents the conductivity, temperature, and flow of the cleaning
solution supplied to the TT/3 filling machine on its monitor. As the **TTCU**
can support two TT/3 filling machines, the logger also shows which of the two
machines the unit supplies cleaning solution to.[//]: # (Start of section

### Measured Parameters

Parameter| Unit  
---|---  
Conductivity| mS/Cm  
Temperature| °C  
Flow| m3  
Machine| 20XXX or 20YYY  
The measured parameters are recorded on the logger when the cleaning program
is chosen on the **TPOP** , and the **TTCU** is in operation. The logger
stores all of the measured parameters on its memory card.The memory card has
enough room to record continuously for 15 months. The log from the logger can
be used to diagnose the cleaning systems and to find the cause of any
malfunction of the unit. The diagnosis can be done on a **PC**. The log files
can be moved from the memory card to a computer, where an add-in for Microsoft
Excel can be used to present the data in several different ways.[//]: # (Start

## Logger RVG200

[//]: # (Start of section about Functional Description)

### Functional Description

The logger presents the conductivity, temperature, and flow of the cleaning
solution supplied to the TT/3 filling machine on its monitor. As the **TTCU**
can support two TT/3 filling machines, the logger also shows which of the two
machines the unit supplies cleaning solution to.[//]: # (Start of section
about Measured Parameters)

### Measured Parameters

Parameter| Unit  
---|---  
Conductivity| mS/Cm  
Temperature| °C  
Flow| m3  
Machine| 20XXX or 20YYY  
The measured parameters are recorded on the logger when the cleaning program
is chosen on the **TPOP** , and the **TTCU** is in operation. The logger
stores all of the measured parameters on its memory card.The memory card has
enough room to record continuously for 15 months. The log from the logger can
be used to diagnose the cleaning systems and to find the cause of any
malfunction of the unit. The diagnosis can be done on a **PC**. The log files
can be moved from the memory card to a computer, where an add-in for Microsoft
Excel can be used to present the data in several different ways.[//]: # (Start
of section about Alarms)

### Alarms

If the measured parameters are outside of the specified limits, a yellow alarm
will be triggered.[//]: # (Start of section about Logger - Set a Name for the

### Functional Description

See OM for more information about the **GSU** such as Control Panel, and
alarms and troubleshooting.The granulate supply unit ( **GSU** ) is a supply
unit to the filling machine that consists of a Central granulate unit and a
Granulate container. The Granulate container is available in different sizes.
Also a Granulate hopper is needed to balance the distribution. The Central
granulate unit and the Granulate container can be placed up to 50 m from the
filling machine, while the Granulate hopper is connected to the filling
machine.The **GSU** provides the filling machine with a vacuum pressure
allowing the filling machine to collect granulate. One **GSU** can serve up to
eight filling machines at the same time.[//]: # (The image below is used to
illustrate the steps in the procedure (explained above in text))

  1. Central granulate unit
  2. Granulate container
  3. Granulate hopper

When a signal is transmitted from a filling machine to the **GSU** , the fan
starts. A vacuum Valve shifts at the same time the fan starts, changing the
direction of the airflow to clean the Filter. The valve shifts back a few
moments later building up a vacuum. During the automatic cleaning of the
Filter, some granulate and dust is gathered in the Plastic bag below the
Filter.[//]: # (The image below is used to illustrate the steps in the

side of the machine, this side can be shutdown and the production can continue
on the other side. Some machine parts are driven by the same motor on S1 and
S2. These machine movements will still continue on the side that is
shutdown.To avoid mechanical wear and damage on machine parts, these parts
must be disconnected mechanically before the side is shutdown from the
operators panel. Affected parts are in Carton Section and Package Section.

### CIP Concentration of Cleaning Solution

The following instructions describe how to check the concentration of
detergent solutions used in **CIP**. The check is made either by measuring the
electrical conductivity of the detergent solution or by using the titration
method.[//]: # (Start of section about CIP Concentration of Cleaning Solution

Open vessel (Ø 150 mm)  
Electrical conductivity depends on the temperature and increases when
temperature rises due to increased molecular motion.In the conductivity meter,
the temperature compensation is done automatically so the measurement is
accurate regardless of the temperature of cleaning solution.The measured
electrical conductivity is related to the concentration in a calibration
curve. The illustration shows the conductivity for the three most common
cleaning chemicals as a function of concentration at 25°C.[//]: # (The image

Consumables| Hydrochloric acid (HCl)  
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)  
Phenolphthalein 5% solution (alcohol based)  
In titration, the neutralisation reaction between an acid and a base, is
utilised. A certain volume of the test solution (for example, nitric acid
solution) is metered into a beaker. A titre solution (for example, sodium
hydroxide solution of a known concentration) is added to the test solution
until it becomes neutral. An indicator is added to the test solution to
determine when the solution is neutral. Phenolphthalein indicator changes
colour about pH7 and is therefore commonly used for acid/base titration.The
test solution concentration can be calculated based on the titrant volume that
is used, titrant concentration, and test solution volume.The test solution
concentration can also be obtained by using titration diagrams.

For recommended concentrations, see Section Chemicals for Cleaning and
Disinfection.[//]: # (The list below contains the different steps in order)

  1. Collect a 10ml sample of the alkali or acid cleaning solution that is used during **CIP**.
  2. Add three to five drops of the indicator solution to the test solution.
  3. Titrate with the titre solution until a colour change is seen.The colour changes from colourless to pink for an acid solution.The colour changes from pink to colourless for an alkaline solution.
  4. Calculate the concentration using the information in Sections Calculation or use the Titration Diagrams.

#### Calculation

    *  _NaOH-concentration =_ _x_ = the volume, in ml, of 0.1mole/l HCl used to obtain a colour change, when 10ml NaOH solution is titrated.
    *  _NaOH-concentration =_ _y_ = the volume, in ml, of 1mole/l HCl used to obtain a colour change, when 10ml NaOH solution is titrated.
    *  _HNO_ _z_ = the volume, in ml, of 0.1mole/l NaOH used to obtain a colour change, when 10ml HNO3 solution is titrated.
    *  _H_ _v_ = the volume, in ml, of 0.1mole/l NaOH used to obtain a colour change, when 10m1 H3PO4 solution is titrated.

### Chemicals for Cleaning and Disinfection

Risk of explosion.Only use Tetra Pak recommended cleaning agents when cleaning
or disinfecting parts that can come into contact with hydrogen
peroxide.Cleaning with non recommended cleaning agents, for example agents
including alcohol, can cause explosions if they come into contact with
hydrogen peroxide.

Hazardous substances.Read the manufacturer’s instructions and carefully follow
the warning texts on the containers. Also see Section Hazardous Substances in
the Safety Precautions chapter.Contact with chemicals can be hazardous to your
health.

Hazardous substances.Do not use chlorine or iodine based cleaning agents or
disinfectants when cleaning or disinfecting parts that can come into contact
with hydrogen peroxide.Risk of hydrogen peroxide decomposition.

Comparable qualities from other suppliers may be selected in compliance with
the technical requirements listed in the table.All cleaning
agents/disinfectants must comply with local legal requirements.The supplier
recommendations for concentration and temperature should be followed. When
dosing the products automatically, their concentrations should be checked.

*****) One way to ensure that the concentration of NaOH, HNO3, or H3PO in the
cleaning solutions do not exceed the maximum value, is to use formulated
cleaning detergents. Formulated cleaning detergents contain, besides lower
concentration of NaOH, HNO3, or H3PO, additives to enhance their cleaning
effects.

See Safety Precautions for locations of the safeguards. **Note:** On some
machines (Brazil) the doors must be closed before the alarm can be
acknowledged on the TPOP . The yellow warning lamp will a fixed light.

    1. Step up the machine to Pre-heating.
    2. Open a door and check that the **TPOP** ladder stops flashing. 
      * When the door is open, confirm that the corresponding door symbol on the **TPOP** appears and the yellow warning lamp is flashing. If not, replace the door safety switch and set it according to procedure Safety Switch - Set and perform a new check.
    3. Acknowledge the alarm on the **TPOP** ,
      * the yellow warning lamp shows a fixed light.
    4. Close the door,
      * the corresponding door symbol on the **TPOP** and the yellow warning lamp goes out.
    5. Repeat the item [Reference](StepUpTheMachineToPre-heating.-1E0B841B) to [Reference](CloseTheDoortheCorrespondingDoorSym-1E0B859E) on all doors.
For a more accurate test perform the TT/3 2000 safety system check as follows.
Perform this test every time the safety system have been rebuilt, reconnected
or if a component in the safety system have been replaced by another.

#### Check Service Switch Function

Risk of serious personal injury.The machine contains many safety hazards while
it is in operation. The machine must never be operated with the doors open and
the door guards must under no circumstances be over-bridged.

    1. Remove the two Screw and the Sensor.
    2. Loosen the two Screw.
    3. Set the Bracket so the Sensor and the Non-contact safety sensor are separated with the distance **A**. Make sure that the Marker are aligned.
    4. Tighten the two Screw.
    5. Attach the Sensor and the two Screw.
    6. Repeat the procedure for all the door guards.
    7. Close the doors and make sure that the Sensor indicator is lit with a steady green light. If it is not the safety switch is incorrectly set.

See Chapter Safety Precautions for locations of the safeguards.

    1. Step up the machine to Pre-heating.
    2. Open a door and check that the **TPOP** ladder stops flashing. 
      * When the door is open, confirm that the corresponding door symbol on the **TPOP** appears and the yellow warning lamp is flashing. If not, replace the door safety switch and set it according to procedure Safety Switch - Set and perform a new check.
    3. Close the door.
      * the yellow warning lamp shows a fixed light.
    4. Reset the alarm on the **TPOP**.
      * the corresponding door symbol on the **TPOP** and the yellow warning lamp goes out.
    5. Repeat the item [Reference](StepUpTheMachineToPre-heating.-1E0B841B) to [Reference](CloseTheDoortheCorrespondingDoorSym-1E0B859E) on all doors.
For a more accurate test perform the TT/3 2000 safety system check as follows.
Perform this test every time the safety system have been rebuilt, reconnected
or if a component in the safety system have been replaced by another.

section about General)

### General

Risk of death or serious injury.To ensure the performance of the safety
related parts of the control system, any modifications must be performed such
that there is no change in the status and integrity of the categories or
performance levels of the applied safety functions.Any modifications that
change the different categories or performance levels of the applied safety
functions can lead to a dangerous failure in the safety system. The machine is
equipped with a safety system containing emergency stops, interlocking door
guards, and so on. Categories and performance level of the separate functions
are given in Section Emergency Stop and Safety Zones in the Machine.

[//]: # (Start of section about Description of System)

### Description of System

The safety system of the TT/3 is managed by the safety PLC:s. See the PLC
table in Section List of Safety Components. The safety relay expansion modules
are listed in the Relay Expansion Modules table in Section List of Safety
Components.The machine is divided into several safety zones. When a door in
any safety zone is opened, a signal is sent to the safety PLC, which will then
take actions to put that zone into a safe state.When any emergency stop button
is pressed on the machine, all the safety zones are put into a safe
state.[//]: # (Start of section about List of Safety Components)

### List of Safety Components

All components included in the safety system are listed in this section.

Risk of death or serious injury.All safety components which are included in
the safety system must be replaced with those components which are designated
in the Spare Parts Catalogue.Replacement of safety components, which are
included in the safety system, with components that are not designated in the
Spare Parts Catalogue, can lead to a dangerous failure in the safety system.

[//]: # (Start of section about General)

### General

The integrity of the safety system is based on the fault exclusions given in
the following subsections.

Risk of death or serious injury.Ensure that all the listed conditions for the
fault exclusion are fulfilled.Altering the conditions given in the fault
conditions will lead to a hazardous situation.

[//]: # (Start of section about Fault Exclusion Short Circuit Inside Cabinet)

### Fault Exclusion Short Circuit Inside Cabinet

A fault exclusion has been made inside the electrical cabinet for short-
circuits between conductors.To maintain the justification and the safety
performance level, the following conditions must be fulfilled:

  * The electrical cabinet must be kept locked, with access restricted to skilled or instructed persons.
  * The protective bonding circuit must be maintained.
  * The degree of protection of the electrical cabinet must not be reduced so that there is a risk of ingress of water or dust below the prior level of protection.
  * The lids of the cable ducts must be restored after maintenance.
